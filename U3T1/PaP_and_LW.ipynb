              "'is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession  of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.    However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his  first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds  of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful  property of some one or other of their daughters.    “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that  Netherfield Park is let at last?”    Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.    “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she  told me all about it.”    Mr. Bennet made no answer.    “Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.    “_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”    ]    This was invitation enough.    “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken  by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came  down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much  delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is  to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be  in the house by the end of next week.”    “What is his name?”    “Bingley.”    “Is he married or single?”    “Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or  five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”    “How so? how can it affect them?”    “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You  must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”    “Is that his design in settling here?”    “Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he  _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as  soon as he comes.”    “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send  them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are  as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the  party.”    “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but  I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five  grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”    “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”    “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into  the neighbourhood.”    “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”    “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would  be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,  merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new  comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit  him, if you do not.”    “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very  glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my  hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though  I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”    “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the  others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so  good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”    “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are  all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of  quickness than her sisters.”    “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take  delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”    “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They  are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration  these twenty years at least.”    “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”    “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four  thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”    “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not  visit them.”    “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them  all.”    Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,  reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had  been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind  was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,  little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she  fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her  daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.    ]          ]          CHAPTER II.      [Illustration]    Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He  had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his  wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was  paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following  manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he  suddenly addressed her with,--    “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”    “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,  resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”    “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the  assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”    “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces  of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion  of her.”    “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do  not depend on her serving you.”    Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain  herself, began scolding one of her daughters.    “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little  compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”    “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times  them ill.”    “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When  is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”    “To-morrow fortnight.”    “Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till  the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for  she will not know him herself.”    “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce  Mr. Bingley to _her_.”    “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him  myself; how can you be so teasing?”    “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly  very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a  fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after  all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,  as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I  will take it on myself.”    The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,  nonsense!”    “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do  you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on  them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,  Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read  great books, and make extracts.”    Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.    “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.  Bingley.”    “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.    “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I  had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on  him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we  cannot escape the acquaintance now.”    The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.  Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy  was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the  while.    “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should  persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to  neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a  good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a  word about it till now.”    “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,  as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.    “What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was  shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;  or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so  pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but  for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_  the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next  ball.”    “Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the  youngest, I’m the tallest.”    The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would  return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to  dinner.                        CHAPTER III.      [Illustration]    Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five  daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her  husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him  in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and  distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at  last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,  Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been  delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely  agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly  with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of  dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively  hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.    “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”  said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well  married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”    In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten  minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being  admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard  much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more  fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper  window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.    An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had  Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her  housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley  was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to  accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite  disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town  so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that  he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never  settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a  little by starting the idea of his    ]    being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a  report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and  seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a  number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing  that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,  his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the  assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his  two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.    Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant  countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,  with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely  looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention  of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and  the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after  his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen  pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was  much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great  admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust  which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be  proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his  large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,  disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his  friend.    Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal  people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,  was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one  himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for  themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced  only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being  introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in  walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.  His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in  the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.  Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of  his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his  having slighted one of her daughters.    Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit  down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been  standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and  Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his  friend to join it.    “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you  standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better  dance.”    “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am  particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it  would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not  another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to  stand up with.”    “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a  kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my  life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,  uncommonly pretty.”    “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.  Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.    “Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one  of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I  dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”    ]    “Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at  Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,  “She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no  humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted  by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her  smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”    Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth  remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,  however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,  playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.    The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.  Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield  party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been  distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her  mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s  pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most  accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been  fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they  had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good  spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they  were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a  book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a  good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised  such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s  views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he  had a very different story to hear.    “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most  delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well  she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with  her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her  twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second  time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand  up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody  can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going  down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and  asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss  King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane  again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”    “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,  “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of  his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”    “Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He  is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never  in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the  lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”    Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any  description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch  of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some  exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.    “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not  suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at  all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring  him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very  great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my  dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”          [Illustration]          CHAPTER IV.      [Illustration]    When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in  her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much  she admired him.    “He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,  good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,  with such perfect good breeding!”    “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought  likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”    “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I  did not expect such a compliment.”    “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between  us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What  could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help  seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in  the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is  very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a  stupider person.”    “Dear Lizzy!”    “Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.  You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable  in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”    “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak  what I think.”    “I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_  good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of  others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it  everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the  good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing  of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,  too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”    “Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you  converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep  his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming  neighbour in her.”    Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at  the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more  quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and  with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was  very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine  ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the  power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.  They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private  seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the  habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people  of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of  themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in  the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their  memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been  acquired by trade.    Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred  thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,  but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and  sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a  good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those  who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the  remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to  purchase.    His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but  though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no  means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had  married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider  his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of  age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to  look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an  hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied  with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.    Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a  great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the  easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition  could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he  never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley  had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In  understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means  deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,  reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not  inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley  was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually  giving offence.    The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently  characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier  girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;  there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted  with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel  more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people  in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had  felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or  pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too  much.    Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired  her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom  they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore  established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such  commendation to think of her as he chose.          ]          CHAPTER V.      [Illustration]    Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets  were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade  in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the  honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The  distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a  disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;  and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about  a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he  could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by  business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,  though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the  contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,  friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him  courteous.    Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a  valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest  of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was  Elizabeth’s intimate friend.    That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a  ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly  brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.    “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil  self-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”    “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”    “Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be  sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he  _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something  about Mr. Robinson.”    “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not  I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton  assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty  women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his  answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,  beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”    “Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as  if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”    “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said  Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,  is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”    “I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his  ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite  a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he  sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”    ]    “Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.  “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”    “Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he  could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being  spoke to.”    “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless  among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably  agreeable.”    “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very  agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it  was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had  heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come  to the ball in a hack chaise.”    “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I  wish he had danced with Eliza.”    “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,  if I were you.”    “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”    “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride  often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so  very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,  should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_  to be proud.”    “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive  _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”    “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her  reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have  ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human  nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us  who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some  quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different  things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be  proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of  ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”    “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his  sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of  foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”    “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.  Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle  directly.”    The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she  would; and the argument ended only with the visit.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]          CHAPTER VI.      [Illustration]    The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit  was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the  good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was  found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,  a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the  two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest  pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of  everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;  though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,  in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It  was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and  to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference  which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a  way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it  was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane  united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an  uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the  suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss  Lucas.    “It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose  on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be  so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill  from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and  it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the  dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every  attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all  _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are  very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without  encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_  affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he  may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”    “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can  perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to  discover it too.”    “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”    “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal  it, he must find it out.”    “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane  meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they  always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that  every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should  therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his  attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling  in love as much as she chooses.”    “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in  question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined  to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But  these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she  cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its  reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four  dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,  and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite  enough to make her understand his character.”    “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might  only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must  remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four  evenings may do a great deal.”    “Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both  like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other  leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”    “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if  she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a  chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a  twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If  the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or  ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the  least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to  have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as  possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your  life.”    “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not  sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”    Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth  was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some  interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely  allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the  ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no  sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had  hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered  uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To  this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had  detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry  in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and  pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those  of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of  this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made  himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough  to dance with.    He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing  with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so  drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were  assembled.    “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my  conversation with Colonel Forster?”    “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”    “But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see  what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by  being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”    ]    On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have  any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such  a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she  turned to him and said,--    “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well  just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at  Meryton?”    “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady  energetic.”    “You are severe on us.”    “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going  to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”    “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me  to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a  musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would  really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of  hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,  she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing  at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is  of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and  I shall keep mine to swell my song.”    Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song  or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she  would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her  sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in  the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always  impatient for display.    Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her  application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited  manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she  had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with  much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the  end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by  Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with  some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in  dancing at one end of the room.    Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of  passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too  much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas  was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--    “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is  nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first  refinements of polished societies.”    “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst  the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”    Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he  continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt  not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”    “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”    “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do  you often dance at St. James’s?”    “Never, sir.”    “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”    “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”    “You have a house in town, I conclude?”    Mr. Darcy bowed.    “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of  superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of  London would agree with Lady Lucas.”    He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to  make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was  struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to  her,--    “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow  me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You  cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”  And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though  extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly  drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--    “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you  not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”    Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of  her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at  all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.    “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me  the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the  amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us  for one half hour.”    “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.    “He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we  cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a  partner?”    Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured  her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some  complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--    “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”    “I should imagine not.”    “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many  evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of  your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the  noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these  people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”    “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more  agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure  which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”    Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he  would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.  Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--    “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”    “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you  joy?”    “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s  imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love  to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”    “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as  absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and  of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”    He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to  entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her  that all was safe, her wit flowed along.          ]          CHAPTER VII.      [Illustration]    Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two  thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,  in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s  fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply  the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and  had left her four thousand pounds.    She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their  father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in  London in a respectable line of trade.    The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most  convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted  thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and  to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,  Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:  their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing  better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning  hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of  news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn  some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both  with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in  the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was  the head-quarters.    Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting  intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the  officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,  and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips  visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity  unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.  Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their  mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of  an ensign.    After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.  Bennet coolly observed,--    “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two  of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but  I am now convinced.”    Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect  indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and  her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the  next morning to London.    “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so  ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly  of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”    “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”    “Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”    “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I  had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must  so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly  foolish.”    “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of  their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will  not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I  liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my  heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,  should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought  Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in  his regimentals.”    “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain  Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first  came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”    Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a  note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited  for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was  eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--    “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,  Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”    “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.         /* NIND “My dear friend, */         “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and       me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our       lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never       end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of       this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.       Yours ever,    “CAROLINE BINGLEY.”    “With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of  _that_.”    “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”    “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.    “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to  rain; and then you must stay all night.”    “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that  they would not offer to send her home.”    “Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;  and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”    “I had much rather go in the coach.”    “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are  wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”        “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”    “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose  will be answered.”    She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses  were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her  mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad  day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it  rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was  delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;  Jane certainly could not come back.    “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than  once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next  morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her  contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield  brought the following note for Elizabeth:--         /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */         “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be       imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will       not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on       my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear       of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a       headache, there is not much the matter with me.    “Yours, etc.”    “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note  aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she  should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of  Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”    “Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little  trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays  there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the  carriage.”    Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the  carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was  her only alternative. She declared her resolution.    “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a  thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get  there.”    “I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”    “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the  horses?”    “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,  when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”    “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every  impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,  exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”    “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.  Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off  together.    “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may  see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”    In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one  of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing  field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing  over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last  within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face  glowing with the warmth of exercise.    She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were  assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.  That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such  dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and  Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt  for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their  brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was  good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst  nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the  brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to  the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was  thinking only of his breakfast.    Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss  Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well  enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her  immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving  alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed  for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,  however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,  could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the  extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended  her.    When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth  began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and  solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having  examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a  violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;  advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice  was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head  ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were  the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact  nothing to do elsewhere.    When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very  unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only  wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern  at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer  of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the  present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was  despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring  back a supply of clothes.                        CHAPTER VIII.      [Illustration]    At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six  Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then  poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the  much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very  favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing  this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how  shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked  being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their  indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored  Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.    Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could  regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his  attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling  herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the  others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was  engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.  Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to  eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain  dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.    When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley  began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were  pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:  she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst  thought the same, and added,--    “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent  walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really  looked almost wild.”    “She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very  nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the  country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”    “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep  in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to  hide it not doing its office.”    “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was  all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well  when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite  escaped my notice.”    “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am  inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such  an exhibition.”    “Certainly not.”    “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,  above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by  it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,  a most country-town indifference to decorum.”    “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said  Bingley.    “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,  “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine  eyes.”    “Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A  short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--    “I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet  girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such  a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no  chance of it.”    “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in  Meryton?”    “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”    “That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.    “If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it  would not make them one jot less agreeable.”    “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any  consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.    To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their  hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of  their dear friend’s vulgar relations.    With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on  leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till  late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and  when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go  down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole  party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting  them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the  excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay  below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.    “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”    “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great  reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”    “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I  am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”    “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and  I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”    Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table  where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her  others; all that his library afforded.    “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own  credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more  than I ever looked into.”    Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those  in the room.    “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left  so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at  Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”    “It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many  generations.”    “And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying  books.”    “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as  these.”    “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of  that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be  half as delightful as Pemberley.”    “I wish it may.”    “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that  neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a  finer county in England than Derbyshire.”    “With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”    “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”    “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get  Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”    Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little  attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near  the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest  sister, to observe the game.    “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will  she be as tall as I am?”    “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or  rather taller.”    “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me  so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished  for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”    “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience  to be so very accomplished as they all are.”    “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”    “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and  net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am  sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without  being informed that she was very accomplished.”    “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has  too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no  otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very  far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I  cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my  acquaintance that are really accomplished.”    “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.    “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your  idea of an accomplished woman.”    “Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”    “Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really  esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met  with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,  dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all  this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of  walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word  will be but half deserved.”    “All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add  something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive  reading.”    “I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”    “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all  this?”    “_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and  application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”    Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her  implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who  answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with  bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all  conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the  room.    “Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is  one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other  sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it  succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”    “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,  “there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend  to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is  despicable.”    Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to  continue the subject.    Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and  that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for  immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could  be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most  eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so  unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled  that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet  were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters  declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,  however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to  his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every  possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.          ]          CHAPTER IX.      [Illustration]    Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the  morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the  inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,  and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his  sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a  note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her  own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and  its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her  two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.    Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been  very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was  not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her  restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She  would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried  home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think  it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss  Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all  attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes  that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.    “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be  moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass  a little longer on your kindness.”    “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am  sure, will not hear of her removal.”    “You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,  “that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she  remains with us.”    Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.    “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not  know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a  vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is  always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest  temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to  _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect  over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is  equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I  hope, though you have but a short lease.”    “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I  should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five  minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”    “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.    “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.    “Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”    “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen  through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”    “That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,  intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”    “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in  the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”    “I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were  a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”    “Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at  least that advantage.”    “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for  such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and  unvarying society.”    “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be  observed in them for ever.”    “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a  country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_  going on in the country as in town.”    Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,  turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete  victory over him, continued her triumph,--    “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for  my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal  pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”    “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and  when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their  advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”    “Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that  gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing  at all.”    “Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her  mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not  such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which  you must acknowledge to be true.”    “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with  many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few  neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”    Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his  countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards  Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of  saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if  Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.    “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir  William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so  genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_  is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very  important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”    “Did Charlotte dine with you?”    “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For  my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own  work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to  judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I  assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think  Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”    “She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.    “Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself  has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast  of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody  better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own  partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my  brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my  sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.  But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he  wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”    “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has  been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first  discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”    “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.    “Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is  strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I  am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”    Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth  tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to  speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.  Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to  Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was  unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be  civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,  indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and  soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of  her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to  each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the  youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming  into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.    Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion  and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose  affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high  animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the  attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her  own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was  very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the  ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be  the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer  to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.    “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when  your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of  the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”    Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to  wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter  would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she  added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel  Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”    Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned  instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the  remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,  could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of  all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER X.      [Illustration]    The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss  Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who  continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined  their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching  the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by  messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and  Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.    Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in  attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual  commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness  of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern  with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was  exactly in unison with her opinion of each.    “How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”    He made no answer.    “You write uncommonly fast.”    “You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”    “How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a  year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”    “It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”    “Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”    “I have already told her so once, by your desire.”    “I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend  pens remarkably well.”    “Thank you--but I always mend my own.”    “How can you contrive to write so even?”    He was silent.    “Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,  and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful  little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss  Grantley’s.”    “Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At  present I have not room to do them justice.”    “Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you  always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”    “They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me  to determine.”    “It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with  ease cannot write ill.”    “That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her  brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much  for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”    “My style of writing is very different from yours.”    “Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way  imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”    “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which  means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”    “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”    “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of  humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an  indirect boast.”    “And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”    “The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in  writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of  thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you  think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with  quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any  attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.  Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield  you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of  panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very  laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business  undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”    “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the  foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I  believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this  moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless  precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”    “I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you  would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as  dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were  mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay  till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not  go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”    “You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did  not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much  more than he did himself.”    “I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my  friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am  afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means  intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a  circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I  could.”    “Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention  as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”    “Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for  himself.”    “You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,  but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to  stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,  that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and  the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering  one argument in favour of its propriety.”    “To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit  with you.”    “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of  either.”    “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of  friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make  one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason  one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have  supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the  circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour  thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,  where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no  very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying  with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”    “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange  with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to  appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting  between the parties?”    “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not  forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more  weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure  you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with  myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not  know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in  particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,  when he has nothing to do.”    Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was  rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly  resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her  brother for talking such nonsense.    “I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,  and want to silence this.”    “Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss  Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very  thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”    “What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.  Darcy had much better finish his letter.”    Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.    When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth  for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to  the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the  way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she  seated herself.    Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,  Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books  that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed  on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of  admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because  he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,  at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her  more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in  any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked  him too little to care for his approbation.    After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a  lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near  Elizabeth, said to her,--    “Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an  opportunity of dancing a reel?”    She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some  surprise at her silence.    “Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately  determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’  that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always  delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of  their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell  you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you  dare.”    “Indeed I do not dare.”    Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his  gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her  manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had  never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really  believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he  should be in some danger.    Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great  anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some  assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.    She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of  their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.    “I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the  next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this  desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;  and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after  the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to  check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,  which your lady possesses.”    ]    “Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”    “Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed  in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the  judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different  lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it  taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”    “It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their  colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be  copied.”    At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and  Elizabeth herself.    “I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some  confusion, lest they had been overheard.    “You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without  telling us that you were coming out.”    Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk  by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,  and immediately said,--    “This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the  avenue.”    But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,  laughingly answered,--    “No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to  uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a  fourth. Good-bye.”    She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of  being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered  as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.          ]          '"

              "'\"Christmas won\\'t be Christmas without any presents,\" grumbled Jo, lying  on the rug.    \"It\\'s so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old  dress.    \"I don\\'t think it\\'s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things,  and other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an injured  sniff.    \"We\\'ve got father and mother and each other,\" said Beth contentedly,  from her corner.    The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the  cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,--    \"We haven\\'t got father, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She  didn\\'t say \"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of  father far away, where the fighting was.    Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,--    \"You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this  Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one; and  she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are  suffering so in the army. We can\\'t do much, but we can make our little  sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don\\'t;\" and Meg  shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she  wanted.    \"But I don\\'t think the little we should spend would do any good. We\\'ve  each got a dollar, and the army wouldn\\'t be much helped by our giving  that. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want  to buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I\\'ve wanted it _so_ long,\" said  Jo, who was a bookworm.    \"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,  which no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.    \"I shall get a nice box of Faber\\'s drawing-pencils; I really need them,\"  said Amy decidedly.    \"Mother didn\\'t say anything about our money, and she won\\'t wish us to  give up everything. Let\\'s each buy what we want, and have a little fun;  I\\'m sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels  of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.    \"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when  I\\'m longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone  again.    \"You don\\'t have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you  like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps  you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you\\'re ready to  fly out of the window or cry?\"    \"It\\'s naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things  tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get  so stiff, I can\\'t practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough  hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.    \"I don\\'t believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don\\'t  have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don\\'t  know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if  he isn\\'t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\\'t nice.\"    \"If you mean _libel_, I\\'d say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if  papa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.    \"I know what I mean, and you needn\\'t be _statirical_ about it. It\\'s  proper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,  with dignity.    \"Don\\'t peck at one another, children. Don\\'t you wish we had the money  papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we\\'d be,  if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.    \"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the  King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in  spite of their money.\"    \"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,  we make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"    \"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at  the long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her  hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.    \"Don\\'t, Jo; it\\'s so boyish!\"    \"That\\'s why I do it.\"    \"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"    \"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"    \"\\'Birds in their little nests agree,\\'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with  such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the  \"pecking\" ended for that time.    \"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to  lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off  boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn\\'t matter so much  when you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your  hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"    \"I\\'m not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I\\'ll wear it in two  tails till I\\'m twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down  a chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I\\'ve got to grow up, and be Miss  March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It\\'s bad  enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys\\' games and work and  manners! I can\\'t get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it\\'s  worse than ever now, for I\\'m dying to go and fight with papa, and I can  only stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the  blue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball  bounded across the room.    \"Poor Jo! It\\'s too bad, but it can\\'t be helped; so you must try to be  contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us  girls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that  all the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in  its touch.    \"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and  prim. Your airs are funny now; but you\\'ll grow up an affected little  goose, if you don\\'t take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways  of speaking, when you don\\'t try to be elegant; but your absurd words are  as bad as Jo\\'s slang.\"    \"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,  ready to share the lecture.    \"You\\'re a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one  contradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.    As young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this  moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat  knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly  without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable  old room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for  a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,  chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a  pleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.    Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being  plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet  mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old  Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she  never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very  much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,  gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,  funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it  was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders  had Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the  uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a  woman, and didn\\'t like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called  her--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy  manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom  disturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name  suited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her  own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,  though the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at  least. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling  on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a  young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four  sisters were we will leave to be found out.    The clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair  of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good  effect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened  to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out  of the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was  as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.            [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]    \"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"    \"I thought I\\'d get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.    \"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.    \"I\\'m the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--    \"I\\'m the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the  slippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was  gone.\"    \"I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" said Beth; \"let\\'s each get her something  for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"    \"That\\'s like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.    Every one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the  idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give  her a nice pair of gloves.\"    \"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.    \"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.    \"I\\'ll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won\\'t cost  much, so I\\'ll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.    \"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.    \"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.  Don\\'t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.            [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my                       turn to sit in the big chair]    \"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big  chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the  presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was  dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said  Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.    \"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise  her. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to  do about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,  with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.    \"I don\\'t mean to act any more after this time; I\\'m getting too old for  such things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about  \"dressing-up\" frolics.    \"You won\\'t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown  with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best  actress we\\'ve got, and there\\'ll be an end of everything if you quit the  boards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do  the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"    \"I can\\'t help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don\\'t choose to make  myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down  easily, I\\'ll drop; if I can\\'t, I shall fall into a chair and be  graceful; I don\\'t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned  Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she  was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.              [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]    \"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,  crying frantically, \\'Roderigo! save me! save me!\\'\" and away went Jo,  with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.    Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked  herself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more  suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave  a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread  burn as she watched the fun, with interest.    \"It\\'s no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the  audience laugh, don\\'t blame me. Come on, Meg.\"    Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of  two pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful  incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of  remorse and arsenic, with a wild \"Ha! ha!\"    \"It\\'s the best we\\'ve had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and  rubbed his elbows.    \"I don\\'t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You\\'re  a regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her  sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.    \"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think \\'The Witch\\'s Curse, an  Operatic Tragedy,\\' is rather a nice thing; but I\\'d like to try Macbeth,  if we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing  part. \\'Is that a dagger that I see before me?\\'\" muttered Jo, rolling her  eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.    \"No, it\\'s the toasting fork, with mother\\'s shoe on it instead of the  bread. Beth\\'s stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a  general burst of laughter.    \"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,  and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a  \"can-I-help-you\" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not  elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the  gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in  the world.    \"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,  getting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn\\'t come home to  dinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look  tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\"    While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,  her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to  her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls  flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg  arranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,  overturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and  fro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave  directions to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.    As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly  happy face, \"I\\'ve got a treat for you after supper.\"    A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped  her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her  napkin, crying, \"A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!\"    \"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through  the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving  wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.  March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.    \"Hurry and get done! Don\\'t stop to quirk your little finger, and simper  over your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking in her tea, and dropping her  bread, butter side down, on the carpet, in her haste to get at the  treat.    Beth ate no more, but crept away, to sit in her shadowy corner and brood  over the delight to come, till the others were ready.    \"I think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was  too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg  warmly.    \"Don\\'t I wish I could go as a drummer, a _vivan_--what\\'s its name? or a  nurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.    \"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of  bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.    \"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in  her voice.    \"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his  work faithfully as long as he can, and we won\\'t ask for him back a  minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\"    They all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with Beth at her  feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on  the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter  should happen to be touching.    Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not  touching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little  was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the  homesickness conquered; it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of  lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only  at the end did the writer\\'s heart overflow with fatherly love and  longing for the little girls at home.               [Illustration: It was a cheerful, hopeful letter]    \"Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by  day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection  at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but  remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days  need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that  they will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully,  fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so  beautifully, that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder  than ever of my little women.\"    Everybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn\\'t ashamed of the  great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded  the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother\\'s shoulder  and sobbed out, \"I _am_ a selfish girl! but I\\'ll truly try to be better,  so he mayn\\'t be disappointed in me by and by.\"    \"We all will!\" cried Meg. \"I think too much of my looks, and hate to  work, but won\\'t any more, if I can help it.\"    \"I\\'ll try and be what he loves to call me, \\'a little woman,\\' and not be  rough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere  else,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much  harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.    Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army-sock, and  began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that  lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all  that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy  coming home.            [Illustration: How you used to play Pilgrim\\'s Progress]    Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo\\'s words, by saying in her  cheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim\\'s Progress  when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me  tie my piece-bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks  and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the  cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the house-top,  where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a  Celestial City.\"    \"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and  passing through the Valley where the hobgoblins were!\" said Jo.    \"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs,\"  said Meg.    \"My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our  flowers and arbors and pretty things were, and all stood and sung for  joy up there in the sunshine,\" said Beth, smiling, as if that pleasant  moment had come back to her.    \"I don\\'t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar  and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the  top. If I wasn\\'t too old for such things, I\\'d rather like to play it  over again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things  at the mature age of twelve.    \"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are  playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our  road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the  guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace  which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you  begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get  before father comes home.\"    \"Really, mother? Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very  literal young lady.    \"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth; I rather  think she hasn\\'t got any,\" said her mother.    \"Yes, I have; mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice  pianos, and being afraid of people.\"    Beth\\'s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh; but  nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.    \"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully. \"It is only another name for  trying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to  be good, it\\'s hard work, and we forget, and don\\'t do our best.\"    \"We were in the Slough of Despond to-night, and mother came and pulled  us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions,  like Christian. What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo, delighted with  the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her  duty.    \"Look under your pillows, Christmas morning, and you will find your  guide-book,\" replied Mrs. March.    They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table; then  out came the four little work-baskets, and the needles flew as the girls  made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but to-night no  one grumbled. They adopted Jo\\'s plan of dividing the long seams into  four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,  and in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the  different countries as they stitched their way through them.       [Illustration: No one but Beth could get much music out of the old                                   piano]    At nine they stopped work, and sung, as usual, before they went to bed.  No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano; but she had a  way of softly touching the yellow keys, and making a pleasant  accompaniment to the simple songs they sung. Meg had a voice like a  flute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a  cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always  coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoilt the  most pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could  lisp            \"Crinkle, crinkle, \\'ittle \\'tar,\"    and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.  The first sound in the morning was her voice, as she went about the  house singing like a lark; and the last sound at night was the same  cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar  lullaby.          [Illustration: At nine they stopped work and sung as usual]                             [Illustration: A Merry Christmas]                                       II.                               A MERRY CHRISTMAS.      Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No  stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much  disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because  it was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother\\'s  promise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little  crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful  old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true  guide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a  \"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her pillow. A  green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few  words written by their mother, which made their one present very  precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find  their little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat  looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the  coming day.    In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,  which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her  very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.    \"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to  the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"mother wants us to  read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used  to be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war  trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you  please; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little  every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help  me through the day.\"    Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round  her, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression  so seldom seen on her restless face.    \"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let\\'s do as they do. I\\'ll help you with the  hard words, and they\\'ll explain things if we don\\'t understand,\"  whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters\\'  example.    \"I\\'m glad mine is blue,\" said Amy; and then the rooms were very still  while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to  touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.    \"Where is mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for  their gifts, half an hour later.    \"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin\\', and your ma went  straight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for  givin\\' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin\\',\" replied Hannah, who  had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them  all more as a friend than a servant.    \"She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything  ready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a  basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.  \"Why, where is Amy\\'s bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the little flask  did not appear.    \"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on  it, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the  first stiffness off the new army-slippers.    \"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don\\'t they? Hannah washed and ironed  them for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly  at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.    \"Bless the child! she\\'s gone and put \\'Mother\\' on them instead of \\'M.  March.\\' How funny!\" cried Jo, taking up one.    \"Isn\\'t it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg\\'s  initials are \\'M. M.,\\' and I don\\'t want any one to use these but Marmee,\"  said Beth, looking troubled.    \"It\\'s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for  no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,\" said  Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.    \"There\\'s mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed,  and steps sounded in the hall.    Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters  all waiting for her.    \"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,  surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so  early.    \"Don\\'t laugh at me, Jo! I didn\\'t mean any one should know till the time  came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave  _all_ my money to get it, and I\\'m truly trying not to be selfish any  more.\"    As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap  one; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget  herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \"a  trump,\" while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to  ornament the stately bottle.    \"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about  being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the  minute I was up: and I\\'m _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"    Another bang of the street-door sent the basket under the sofa, and the  girls to the table, eager for breakfast.    \"Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read  some, and mean to every day,\" they cried, in chorus.    \"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I\\'m glad you began at once, and hope  you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far  away from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby. Six  children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have  no fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to  tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give  them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"    They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a  minute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--    \"I\\'m so glad you came before we began!\"    \"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked  Beth, eagerly.    \"_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins,\" added Amy, heroically giving  up the articles she most liked.    Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one  big plate.    \"I thought you\\'d do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You  shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and  milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time.\"    They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was  early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and  no one laughed at the queer party.                     [Illustration: The procession set out]    A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,  ragged bed-clothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,  hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.    How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!    \"Ach, mein Gott! it is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,  crying for joy.    \"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them laughing.    In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work  there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the  broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother  tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she  dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The  girls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and  fed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to  understand the funny broken English.    \"Das ist gut!\" \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things, as they ate,  and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.    The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it  very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \"Sancho\" ever  since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn\\'t  get any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think  there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry  little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves  with bread and milk on Christmas morning.    \"That\\'s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said  Meg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs  collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.    Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in  the few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white  chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave  quite an elegant air to the table.    \"She\\'s coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for  Marmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to  the seat of honor.    Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted  escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;  and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the  little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new  handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy\\'s  cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were  pronounced a \"perfect fit.\"    There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the  simple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at  the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to  work.    The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of  the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being  still too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to  afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their  wits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made  whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their  productions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned  butter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,  glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered  with the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids  of tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being  turned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent  revels.    No gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart\\'s  content, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots  given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,  an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some  picture, were Jo\\'s chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The  smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors  to take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit  for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,  whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.  It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and  employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or  spent in less profitable society.    On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the  dress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a  most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling  and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an  occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the  excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew  apart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.    \"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one play-bill, was represented by a  few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the  distance. This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus  for walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot  on it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the  glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued  from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed  for the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with  a clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious  cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he  struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his  hatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to  kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo\\'s voice, with an  occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,  and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with  the air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and  ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding \"What ho, minion! I need  thee!\"    [Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]    Out came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and  black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded  a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in  a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the  spirit who would bring the love philter:--            \"Hither, hither, from thy home,           Airy sprite, I bid thee come!           Born of roses, fed on dew,           Charms and potions canst thou brew?           Bring me here, with elfin speed,           The fragrant philter which I need;           Make it sweet and swift and strong,           Spirit, answer now my song!\"                [Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]    A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave  appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden  hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,--             \"Hither I come,            From my airy home,          Afar in the silver moon.            Take the magic spell,            And use it well,          Or its power will vanish soon!\"    And, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch\\'s feet, the spirit  vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a  lovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having  croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a  mocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his  boots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had  killed a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and  intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain  fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits  of the play.    A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again; but when  it became evident what a masterpiece of stage-carpentering had been got  up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to  the ceiling; half-way up appeared a window, with a lamp burning at it,  and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver  dress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,  red cloak, chestnut love-locks, a guitar, and the boots, of course.  Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones.  Zara replied, and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came  the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope-ladder, with five  steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she  crept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo\\'s shoulder, and was  about to leap gracefully down, when, \"Alas! alas for Zara!\" she forgot  her train,--it caught in the window; the tower tottered, leaned forward,  fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!    A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the  wreck, and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so! I told you  so!\" With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed  in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside,--    \"Don\\'t laugh! Act as if it was all right!\"--and, ordering Roderigo up,  banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly  shaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old  gentleman, and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she  also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons  of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains, and led them  away, looking very much frightened, and evidently forgetting the speech  he ought to have made.    Act third was the castle hall; and here Hagar appeared, having come to  free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming, and hides; sees  him put the potions into two cups of wine, and bid the timid little  servant \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall  come anon.\" The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and  Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando,  the \"minion,\" carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds  the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long  warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and, after a good deal of clutching  and stamping, falls flat and dies; while Hagar informs him what she has  done in a song of exquisite power and melody.    This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought  that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred  the effect of the villain\\'s death. He was called before the curtain, and  with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was  considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put  together.    Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing  himself, because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as  the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,  informing him that Zara is true, but in danger, and he can save her, if  he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of  rapture he tears off his chains, and rushes away to find and rescue his  lady-love.    Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He  wishes her to go into a convent, but she won\\'t hear of it; and, after a  touching appeal, is about to faint, when Roderigo dashes in and demands  her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and  gesticulate tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo is about to  bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a  letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The  latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young  pair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn\\'t make them happy. The  bag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the  stage, till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely  softens the \"stern sire\": he consents without a murmur, all join in a  joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive  Don Pedro\\'s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.      [Illustration: The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro\\'s blessing]    Tumultuous applause followed, but received an unexpected check; for the  cot-bed, on which the \"dress-circle\" was built, suddenly shut up, and  extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to  the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless  with laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided, when Hannah appeared,  with \"Mrs. March\\'s compliments, and would the ladies walk down to  supper.\"    This was a surprise, even to the actors; and, when they saw the table,  they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to  get up a little treat for them; but anything so fine as this was  unheard-of since the departed days of plenty. There was  ice-cream,--actually two dishes of it, pink and white,--and cake and  fruit and distracting French bonbons, and, in the middle of the table,  four great bouquets of hot-house flowers!    It quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and  then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.    \"Is it fairies?\" asked Amy,    \"It\\'s Santa Claus,\" said Beth.    \"Mother did it\"; and Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard  and white eyebrows.    \"Aunt March had a good fit, and sent the supper,\" cried Jo, with a  sudden inspiration.    \"All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.    \"The Laurence boy\\'s grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into  his head? We don\\'t know him!\" exclaimed Meg.    \"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an  odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father, years ago;  and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would  allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending  them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse; and so you  have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk  breakfast.\"    \"That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He\\'s a capital fellow,  and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he\\'d like to know us;  but he\\'s bashful, and Meg is so prim she won\\'t let me speak to him when  we pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt  out of sight, with \"Ohs!\" and \"Ahs!\" of satisfaction.    \"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don\\'t you?\"  asked one of the girls. \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence; but says he\\'s  very proud, and doesn\\'t like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his  grandson shut up, when he isn\\'t riding or walking with his tutor, and  makes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn\\'t  come. Mother says he\\'s very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.\"    \"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the  fence, and were getting on capitally,--all about cricket, and so  on,--when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some  day; for he needs fun, I\\'m sure he does,\" said Jo decidedly.                    [Illustration: We talked over the fence]    \"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman; so I\\'ve no  objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought  the flowers himself; and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure  what was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,  hearing the frolic, and evidently having none of his own.\"    \"It\\'s a mercy you didn\\'t, mother!\" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.  \"But we\\'ll have another play, some time, that he _can_ see. Perhaps  he\\'ll help act; wouldn\\'t that be jolly?\"    \"I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!\" And Meg  examined her flowers with great interest.    \"They _are_ lovely! But Beth\\'s roses are sweeter to me,\" said Mrs.  March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.    Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \"I wish I could send my  bunch to father. I\\'m afraid he isn\\'t having such a merry Christmas as we  are.\"                           [Illustration: Tail-piece]            [Illustration: Eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe\"]                                      III.                               THE LAURENCE BOY.      \"Jo! Jo! where are you?\" cried Meg, at the foot of the garret stairs.    \"Here!\" answered a husky voice from above; and, running up, Meg found  her sister eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe,\"  wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny  window. This was Jo\\'s favorite refuge; and here she loved to retire with  half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society  of a pet rat who lived near by, and didn\\'t mind her a particle. As Meg  appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her  cheeks, and waited to hear the news.    \"Such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for  to-morrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper, and then  proceeding to read it, with girlish delight.    \"\\'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a  little dance on New-Year\\'s Eve.\\' Marmee is willing we should go; now  what _shall_ we wear?\"    \"What\\'s the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins,  because we haven\\'t got anything else?\" answered Jo, with her mouth full.    \"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg. \"Mother says I may when I\\'m  eighteen, perhaps; but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\"    \"I\\'m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.  Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.  Whatever shall I do? the burn shows badly, and I can\\'t take any out.\"    \"You must sit still all you can, and keep your back out of sight; the  front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee  will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and  my gloves will do, though they aren\\'t as nice as I\\'d like.\"    \"Mine are spoilt with lemonade, and I can\\'t get any new ones, so I shall  have to go without,\" said Jo, who never troubled herself much about  dress.    \"You _must_ have gloves, or I won\\'t go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves  are more important than anything else; you can\\'t dance without them, and  if you don\\'t I should be _so_ mortified.\"    \"Then I\\'ll stay still. I don\\'t care much for company dancing; it\\'s no  fun to go sailing round; I like to fly about and cut capers.\"    \"You can\\'t ask mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are  so careless. She said, when you spoilt the others, that she shouldn\\'t  get you any more this winter. Can\\'t you make them do?\" asked Meg  anxiously.    \"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained  they are; that\\'s all I can do. No! I\\'ll tell you how we can manage--each  wear one good one and carry a bad one; don\\'t you see?\"    \"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove  dreadfully,\" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.    \"Then I\\'ll go without. I don\\'t care what people say!\" cried Jo, taking  up her book.    \"You may have it, you may! only don\\'t stain it, and do behave nicely.  Don\\'t put your hands behind you, or stare, or say \\'Christopher  Columbus!\\' will you?\"    \"Don\\'t worry about me; I\\'ll be as prim as I can, and not get into any  scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me  finish this splendid story.\"    So Meg went away to \"accept with thanks,\" look over her dress, and sing  blithely as she did up her one real lace frill; while Jo finished her  story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.    On New-Year\\'s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls  played dressing-maids, and the two elder were absorbed in the  all-important business of \"getting ready for the party.\" Simple as the  toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing  and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burnt hair pervaded the  house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch  the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.            [Illustration: Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks]    \"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth, from her perch on the bed.    \"It\\'s the dampness drying,\" replied Jo.    \"What a queer smell! it\\'s like burnt feathers,\" observed Amy, smoothing  her own pretty curls with a superior air.    \"There, now I\\'ll take off the papers and you\\'ll see a cloud of little  ringlets,\" said Jo, putting down the tongs.    She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the  hair came with the papers, and the horrified hair-dresser laid a row of  little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.    \"Oh, oh, oh! what _have_ you done? I\\'m spoilt! I can\\'t go! My hair, oh,  my hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her  forehead.    \"Just my luck! you shouldn\\'t have asked me to do it; I always spoil  everything. I\\'m so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I\\'ve made a  mess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the black pancakes with tears of  regret.    \"It isn\\'t spoilt; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come  on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I\\'ve  seen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.    \"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I\\'d let my hair alone,\"  cried Meg petulantly.    \"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\"  said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.    After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the  united exertions of the family Jo\\'s hair was got up and her dress on.  They looked very well in their simple suits,--Meg in silvery drab, with  a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin; Jo in maroon, with  a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for  her only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one  soiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite easy and fine.\" Meg\\'s  high-heeled slippers were very tight, and hurt her, though she would not  own it, and Jo\\'s nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her  head, which was not exactly comfortable; but, dear me, let us be elegant  or die!    \"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went  daintily down the walk. \"Don\\'t eat much supper, and come away at eleven,  when I send Hannah for you.\" As the gate clashed behind them, a voice  cried from a window,--    \"Girls, girls! _have_ you both got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?\"    \"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding,  with a laugh, as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we  were all running away from an earthquake.\"    \"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady  is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\" replied Meg,  who had a good many little \"aristocratic tastes\" of her own.    \"Now don\\'t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash  right? and does my hair look _very_ bad?\" said Meg, as she turned from  the glass in Mrs. Gardiner\\'s dressing-room, after a prolonged prink.    \"I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind  me by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her  head a hasty brush.    \"No, winking isn\\'t lady-like; I\\'ll lift my eyebrows if anything is  wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulders straight,  and take short steps, and don\\'t shake hands if you are introduced to any  one: it isn\\'t the thing.\"    \"How _do_ you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn\\'t that music  gay?\"                 [Illustration: Mrs. Gardiner greeted them]    Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties,  and, informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them.  Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly, and handed them  over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie, and was at her  ease very soon; but Jo, who didn\\'t care much for girls or girlish  gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt  as much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial  lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she  longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.  She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly  that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the  group near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not  roam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she  stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked  at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would  have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big  red-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage  her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy  herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the  same refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face  to face with the \"Laurence boy.\"               [Illustration: Face to face with the Laurence boy]    \"Dear me, I didn\\'t know any one was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to  back out as speedily as she had bounced in.    But the boy laughed, and said pleasantly, though he looked a little  startled,--    \"Don\\'t mind me; stay, if you like.\"    \"Sha\\'n\\'t I disturb you?\"    \"Not a bit; I only came here because I don\\'t know many people, and felt  rather strange at first, you know.\"    \"So did I. Don\\'t go away, please, unless you\\'d rather.\"    The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to  be polite and easy,--    \"I think I\\'ve had the pleasure of seeing you before; you live near us,  don\\'t you?\"    \"Next door\"; and he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo\\'s prim manner  was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket  when he brought the cat home.    That put Jo at her ease; and she laughed too, as she said, in her  heartiest way,--    \"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\"    \"Grandpa sent it.\"    \"But you put it into his head, didn\\'t you, now?\"    \"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober,  while his black eyes shone with fun.    \"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I\\'m only Jo,\"  returned the young lady.    \"I\\'m not Mr. Laurence, I\\'m only Laurie.\"    \"Laurie Laurence,--what an odd name!\"    \"My first name is Theodore, but I don\\'t like it, for the fellows called  me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"    \"I hate my name, too--so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo,  instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"    \"I thrashed \\'em.\"    \"I can\\'t thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it\"; and  Jo resigned herself with a sigh.    \"Don\\'t you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he  thought the name suited her.    \"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and every one is  lively. In a place like this I\\'m sure to upset something, tread on  people\\'s toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief, and  let Meg sail about. Don\\'t you dance?\"    \"Sometimes; you see I\\'ve been abroad a good many years, and haven\\'t been  into company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"    \"Abroad!\" cried Jo. \"Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people  describe their travels.\"    Laurie didn\\'t seem to know where to begin; but Jo\\'s eager questions soon  set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where  the boys never wore hats, and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for  holiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.    \"Don\\'t I wish I\\'d been there!\" cried Jo. \"Did you go to Paris?\"    \"We spent last winter there.\"    \"Can you talk French?\"    \"We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay.\"    \"Do say some! I can read it, but can\\'t pronounce.\"    \"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\" said Laurie  good-naturedly.    \"How nicely you do it! Let me see,--you said, \\'Who is the young lady in  the pretty slippers,\\' didn\\'t you?\"    \"Oui, mademoiselle.\"    \"It\\'s my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is  pretty?\"    \"Yes; she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and  quiet, and dances like a lady.\"    Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and  stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticised and chatted,  till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie\\'s bashfulness soon wore  off; for Jo\\'s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and  Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody  lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \"Laurence boy\" better than  ever, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him  to the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys  were almost unknown creatures to them.    \"Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine  teeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy,  and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?\"    It was on the tip of Jo\\'s tongue to ask; but she checked herself in  time, and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a roundabout way.    \"I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your  books,--no, I mean studying hard\"; and Jo blushed at the dreadful  \"pegging\" which had escaped her.    Laurie smiled, but didn\\'t seem shocked, and answered, with a shrug,--    \"Not for a year or two; I won\\'t go before seventeen, anyway.\"    \"Aren\\'t you but fifteen?\" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she  had imagined seventeen already.    \"Sixteen, next month.\"    \"How I wish I was going to college! You don\\'t look as if you liked it.\"    \"I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don\\'t like the way  fellows do either, in this country.\"    \"What do you like?\"    \"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\"    Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was; but his black brows  looked rather threatening as he knit them; so she changed the subject by  saying, as her foot kept time, \"That\\'s a splendid polka! Why don\\'t you  go and try it?\"    \"If you will come too,\" he answered, with a gallant little bow.    \"I can\\'t; for I told Meg I wouldn\\'t, because--\" There Jo stopped, and  looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.    \"Because what?\" asked Laurie curiously.    \"You won\\'t tell?\"    \"Never!\"    \"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my  frocks, and I scorched this one; and, though it\\'s nicely mended, it  shows, and Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You may  laugh, if you want to; it is funny, I know.\"    But Laurie didn\\'t laugh; he only looked down a minute, and the  expression of his face puzzled Jo, when he said very gently,--    \"Never mind that; I\\'ll tell you how we can manage: there\\'s a long hall  out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please  come?\"    Jo thanked him, and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves, when  she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was  empty, and they had a grand polka; for Laurie danced well, and taught  her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring.  When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath;  and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students\\' festival at  Heidelberg, when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and  Jo reluctantly followed her into a side-room, where she found her on a  sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.                  [Illustration: They sat down on the stairs]    \"I\\'ve sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned, and gave me a sad  wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don\\'t know how I\\'m ever  going to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.    \"I knew you\\'d hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I\\'m sorry. But I  don\\'t see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all  night,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.    \"I can\\'t have a carriage, without its costing ever so much. I dare say I  can\\'t get one at all; for most people come in their own, and it\\'s a long  way to the stable, and no one to send.\"    \"I\\'ll go.\"    \"No, indeed! It\\'s past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can\\'t stop here, for  the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I\\'ll rest  till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"    \"I\\'ll ask Laurie; he will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea  occurred to her.    \"Mercy, no! Don\\'t ask or tell any one. Get me my rubbers, and put these  slippers with our things. I can\\'t dance any more; but as soon as supper  is over, watch for Hannah, and tell me the minute she comes.\"    \"They are going out to supper now. I\\'ll stay with you; I\\'d rather.\"    \"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I\\'m so tired, I can\\'t  stir!\"    So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away  to the dining-room, which she found after going into a china-closet, and  opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little  private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee,  which she immediately spilt, thereby making the front of her dress as  bad as the back.    \"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg\\'s glove  by scrubbing her gown with it.    \"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice; and there was Laurie, with a  full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.    \"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and some one  shook me; and here I am, in a nice state,\" answered Jo, glancing  dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.    \"Too bad! I was looking for some one to give this to. May I take it to  your sister?\"    \"Oh, thank you! I\\'ll show you where she is. I don\\'t offer to take it  myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"    Jo led the way; and, as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a  little table, brought a second instalment of coffee and ice for Jo, and  was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \"nice boy.\"  They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the  midst of a quiet game of \"Buzz,\" with two or three other young people  who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot, and rose  so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation  of pain.    \"Hush! Don\\'t say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It\\'s nothing.  I turned my foot a little, that\\'s all\"; and limped up-stairs to put her  things on.    Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits\\' end, till she  decided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down,  and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It  happened to be a hired waiter, who knew nothing about the neighborhood;  and Jo was looking round for help, when Laurie, who had heard what she  said, came up, and offered his grandfather\\'s carriage, which had just  come for him, he said.    \"It\\'s so early! You can\\'t mean to go yet?\" began Jo, looking relieved,  but hesitating to accept the offer.    \"I always go early,--I do, truly! Please let me take you home? It\\'s all  on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\"    That settled it; and, telling him of Meg\\'s mishap, Jo gratefully  accepted, and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah  hated rain as much as a cat does; so she made no trouble, and they  rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and  elegant. Laurie went on the box; so Meg could keep her foot up, and the  girls talked over their party in freedom.    \"I had a capital time. Did you?\" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and  making herself comfortable.    \"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie\\'s friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to  me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her, when Sallie does.  She is going in the spring, when the opera comes; and it will be  perfectly splendid, if mother only lets me go,\" answered Meg, cheering  up at the thought.    \"I saw you dancing with the red-headed man I ran away from. Was he  nice?\"    \"Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red; and he was very polite, and I  had a delicious redowa with him.\"    \"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit, when he did the new step. Laurie  and I couldn\\'t help laughing. Did you hear us?\"    \"No; but it was very rude. What _were_ you about all that time, hidden  away there?\"    Jo told her adventures, and, by the time she had finished, they were at  home. With many thanks, they said \"Good night,\" and crept in, hoping to  disturb no one; but the instant their door creaked, two little  night-caps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out,--    \"Tell about the party! tell about the party!\"    With what Meg called \"a great want of manners,\" Jo had saved some  bonbons for the little girls; and they soon subsided, after hearing the  most thrilling events of the evening.    \"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home  from the party in a carriage, and sit in my dressing-gown, with a maid  to wait on me,\" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica, and  brushed her hair.    \"I don\\'t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we  do, in spite of our burnt hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight  slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\"  And I think Jo was quite right.                      [Illustration: Tell about the party]               [Illustration: The kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach]                                      IV.                                    BURDENS.      \"Oh dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\" sighed  Meg, the morning after the party; for, now the holidays were over, the  week of merry-making did not fit her for going on easily with the task  she never liked.    \"I wish it was Christmas or New-Year all the time; wouldn\\'t it be fun?\"  answered Jo, yawning dismally.    \"We shouldn\\'t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does  seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and  drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It\\'s like other people,  you know, and I always envy girls who do such things; I\\'m so fond of  luxury,\" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the  least shabby.    \"Well, we can\\'t have it, so don\\'t let us grumble, but shoulder our  bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I\\'m sure Aunt  March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I\\'ve  learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so  light that I sha\\'n\\'t mind her.\"    This idea tickled Jo\\'s fancy, and put her in good spirits; but Meg  didn\\'t brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoilt children,  seemed heavier than ever. She hadn\\'t heart enough even to make herself  pretty, as usual, by putting on a blue neck-ribbon, and dressing her  hair in the most becoming way.    \"Where\\'s the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross  midgets, and no one cares whether I\\'m pretty or not?\" she muttered,  shutting her drawer with a jerk. \"I shall have to toil and moil all my  days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly  and sour, because I\\'m poor, and can\\'t enjoy my life as other girls do.  It\\'s a shame!\"    So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn\\'t at all agreeable  at breakfast-time. Every one seemed rather out of sorts, and inclined to  croak. Beth had a headache, and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort  herself with the cat and three kittens; Amy was fretting because her  lessons were not learned, and she couldn\\'t find her rubbers; Jo _would_  whistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very busy  trying to finish a letter, which must go at once; and Hannah had the  grumps, for being up late didn\\'t suit her.    \"There never _was_ such a cross family!\" cried Jo, losing her temper  when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot-lacings, and sat down  upon her hat.    \"You\\'re the crossest person in it!\" returned Amy, washing out the sum,  that was all wrong, with the tears that had fallen on her slate.    \"Beth, if you don\\'t keep these horrid cats down cellar I\\'ll have them  drowned,\" exclaimed Meg angrily, as she tried to get rid of the kitten,  which had scrambled up her back, and stuck like a burr just out of  reach.    Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed, because she  couldn\\'t remember how much nine times twelve was.    \"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I _must_ get this off by the  early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,\" cried Mrs.  March, crossing out the third spoilt sentence in her letter.    There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two  hot turn-overs on the table, and stalked out again. These turn-overs  were an institution; and the girls called them \"muffs,\" for they had no  others, and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold  mornings. Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy  she might be, for the walk was long and bleak; the poor things got no  other lunch, and were seldom home before two.    \"Cuddle your cats, and get over your headache, Bethy. Good-by, Marmee;  we are a set of rascals this morning, but we\\'ll come home regular  angels. Now then, Meg!\" and Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims  were not setting out as they ought to do.    They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was  always at the window, to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.  Somehow it seemed as if they couldn\\'t have got through the day without  that; for, whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that  motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.    \"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would  serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never  seen,\" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and  bitter wind.    \"Don\\'t use such dreadful expressions,\" said Meg, from the depths of the  vail in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.    \"I like good strong words, that mean something,\" replied Jo, catching  her hat as it took a leap off her head, preparatory to flying away  altogether.    \"Call yourself any names you like; but _I_ am neither a rascal nor a  wretch, and I don\\'t choose to be called so.\"    \"You\\'re a blighted being, and decidedly cross to-day because you can\\'t  sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make  my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice-cream and  high-heeled slippers and posies and red-headed boys to dance with.\"    \"How ridiculous you are, Jo!\" but Meg laughed at the nonsense, and felt  better in spite of herself.    \"Lucky for you I am; for if I put on crushed airs, and tried to be  dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can  always find something funny to keep me up. Don\\'t croak any more, but  come home jolly, there\\'s a dear.\"    Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for  the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm  turn-over, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,  hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.    When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate  friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward  their own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too  early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents  consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in  spite of all obstacles, is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a  place as nursery governess, and felt rich with her small salary. As she  said, she _was_ \"fond of luxury,\" and her chief trouble was poverty. She  found it harder to bear than the others, because she could remember a  time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want  of any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it  was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay  friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings\\' she daily saw  all she wanted, for the children\\'s older sisters were just out, and Meg  caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball-dresses and bouquets, heard  lively gossip about theatres, concerts, sleighing parties, and  merry-makings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which  would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a  sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes, for  she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which  alone can make life happy.    Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame, and needed an active  person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one  of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her  offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost  all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady\\'s will; but the  unworldly Marches only said,--    \"We can\\'t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will  keep together and be happy in one another.\"    The old lady wouldn\\'t speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo  at a friend\\'s, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck  the old lady\\'s fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This  did not suit Jo at all; but she accepted the place since nothing better  appeared, and, to every one\\'s surprise, got on remarkably well with her  irascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo had  marched home, declaring she couldn\\'t bear it any longer; but Aunt March  always cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency  that she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery  old lady.    I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,  which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered  the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges  with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in  his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in  the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the  tall book-cases, the cosy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the  wilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the  library a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or  was busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling  herself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,  travels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all  happiness, it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the  heart of the story, the sweetest verse of the song, or the most perilous  adventure of her traveller, a shrill voice called, \"Josy-phine!  Josy-phine!\" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the  poodle, or read Belsham\\'s Essays by the hour together.              [Illustration: Curling herself up in the big chair]    Jo\\'s ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no  idea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found  her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn\\'t read, run, and  ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless  spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series  of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training  she received at Aunt March\\'s was just what she needed; and the thought  that she was doing something to support herself made her happy, in spite  of the perpetual \"Josy-phine!\"    Beth was too bashful to go to school; it had been tried, but she  suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home,  with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to  devote her skill and energy to Soldiers\\' Aid Societies, Beth went  faithfully on by herself, and did the best she could. She was a  housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and  comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be  loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little  world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy  bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for  Beth was a child still, and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one  whole or handsome one among them; all were outcasts till Beth took them  in; for, when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her,  because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the  more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm  dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals; no harsh words  or blows were ever given them; no neglect ever saddened the heart of the  most repulsive: but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed, with  an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of _dollanity_ had  belonged to Jo; and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in  the rag-bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth, and  taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat  little cap, and, as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these  deficiencies by folding it in a blanket, and devoting her best bed to  this chronic invalid. If any one had known the care lavished on that  dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they  laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets; she read to it, took it out to  breathe the air, hidden under her coat; she sung it lullabys, and never  went to bed without kissing its dirty face, and whispering tenderly, \"I  hope you\\'ll have a good night, my poor dear.\"    Beth had her troubles as well as the others; and not being an angel, but  a very human little girl, she often \"wept a little weep,\" as Jo said,  because she couldn\\'t take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved  music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practised away so patiently  at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if some one (not to  hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw  Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn\\'t keep in tune,  when she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work,  never was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls, and day after day  said hopefully to herself, \"I know I\\'ll get my music some time, if I\\'m  good.\"    There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners  till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the  sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the  sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.    If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she  would have answered at once, \"My nose.\" When she was a baby, Jo had  accidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the  fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor  \"Petrea\\'s\"; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world  could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,  and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a  Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.    \"Little Raphael,\" as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for  drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing  fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her  teachers complained that, instead of doing her sums, she covered her  slate with animals; the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps  on; and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering  out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as  well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of  deportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being  good-tempered, and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.  Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her  accomplishments; for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,  crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of  the words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \"When papa was rich we did  so-and-so,\" which was very touching; and her long words were considered  \"perfectly elegant\" by the girls.    Amy was in a fair way to be spoilt; for every one petted her, and her  small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,  however, rather quenched the vanities; she had to wear her cousin\\'s  clothes. Now Florence\\'s mamma hadn\\'t a particle of taste, and Amy  suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,  unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was  good, well made, and little worn; but Amy\\'s artistic eyes were much  afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull  purple, with yellow dots, and no trimming.    \"My only comfort,\" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \"is, that  mother don\\'t take tucks in my dresses whenever I\\'m naughty, as Maria  Parks\\' mother does. My dear, it\\'s really dreadful; for sometimes she is  so bad, her frock is up to her knees, and she can\\'t come to school. When  I think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my flat  nose and purple gown, with yellow sky-rockets on it.\"    Meg was Amy\\'s confidant and monitor, and, by some strange attraction of  opposites, Jo was gentle Beth\\'s. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her  thoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister, Beth unconsciously  exercised more influence than any one in the family. The two older girls  were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger into  her keeping, and watched over her in her own way; \"playing mother\" they  called it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls, with  the maternal instinct of little women.    \"Has anybody got anything to tell? It\\'s been such a dismal day I\\'m  really dying for some amusement,\" said Meg, as they sat sewing together  that evening.    \"I had a queer time with aunt to-day, and, as I got the best of it, I\\'ll  tell you about it,\" began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. \"I was  reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for  aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like  fury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy; and, before she  began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by  opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.                [Illustration: Reading that everlasting Belsham]    \"\\'I wish I could, and be done with it,\\' said I, trying not to be saucy.    \"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and  think them over while she just \\'lost\\' herself for a moment. She never  finds herself very soon; so the minute her cap began to bob, like a  top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the \\'Vicar of Wakefield\\' out of my pocket,  and read away, with one eye on him, and one on aunt. I\\'d just got to  where they all tumbled into the water, when I forgot, and laughed out  loud. Aunt woke up; and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me  to read a bit, and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy  and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though  she only said,--    \"\\'I don\\'t understand what it\\'s all about. Go back and begin it, child.\\'    \"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.  Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,  \\'I\\'m afraid it tires you, ma\\'am; sha\\'n\\'t I stop now?\\'    \"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me  a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way,--    \"\\'Finish the chapter, and don\\'t be impertinent, miss.\\'\"    \"Did she own she liked it?\" asked Meg.    \"Oh, bless you, no! but she let old Belsham rest; and, when I ran back  after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that  she didn\\'t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall, because of the  good time coming. What a pleasant life she might have, if she only  chose. I don\\'t envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich  people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,\" added Jo.    \"That reminds me,\" said Meg, \"that I\\'ve got something to tell. It isn\\'t  funny, like Jo\\'s story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came  home. At the Kings to-day I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the  children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and  papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking  very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed  me, so I shouldn\\'t see how red their eyes were. I didn\\'t ask any  questions, of course; but I felt so sorry for them, and was rather glad  I hadn\\'t any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.\"    \"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than  anything bad boys can do,\" said Amy, shaking her head, as if her  experience of life had been a deep one. \"Susie Perkins came to school  to-day with a lovely red carnelian ring; I wanted it dreadfully, and  wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr.  Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, \\'Young ladies,  my eye is upon you!\\' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were  laughing over it, when all of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he  ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was _parry_lized with fright,  but she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did? He took her by the  ear, the ear! just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation  platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding that slate so  every one could see.\"              [Illustration: He took her by the ear! by the ear!]    \"Didn\\'t the girls laugh at the picture?\" asked Jo, who relished the  scrape.    \"Laugh? Not one! They sat as still as mice; and Susie cried quarts, I  know she did. I didn\\'t envy her then; for I felt that millions of  carnelian rings wouldn\\'t have made me happy, after that. I never, never  should have got over such a agonizing mortification.\" And Amy went on  with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue, and the successful  utterance of two long words in a breath.    \"I saw something that I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at  dinner, but I forgot,\" said Beth, putting Jo\\'s topsy-turvy basket in  order as she talked. \"When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.  Laurence was in the fish-shop; but he didn\\'t see me, for I kept behind a  barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter, the fish-man. A poor woman came  in, with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do  some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn\\'t any dinner for her  children, and had been disappointed of a day\\'s work. Mr. Cutter was in a  hurry, and said \\'No,\\' rather crossly; so she was going away, looking  hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the  crooked end of his cane, and held it out to her. She was so glad and  surprised, she took it right in her arms, and thanked him over and over.  He told her to \\'go along and cook it,\\' and she hurried off, so happy!  Wasn\\'t it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,  slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence\\'s bed in heaven would be \\'aisy.\\'\"               [Illustration: Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish]    When they had laughed at Beth\\'s story, they asked their mother for one;  and, after a moment\\'s thought, she said soberly,--    \"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets to-day, at the rooms, I felt  very anxious about father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should  be, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do; but I  kept on worrying, till an old man came in, with an order for some  clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him; for he looked  poor and tired and anxious.    \"\\'Have you sons in the army?\\' I asked; for the note he brought was not  to me.    \"\\'Yes, ma\\'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and  I\\'m going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital,\\' he  answered quietly.    \"\\'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,\\' I said, feeling  respect now, instead of pity.    \"\\'Not a mite more than I ought, ma\\'am. I\\'d go myself, if I was any use;  as I ain\\'t, I give my boys, and give \\'em free.\\'    \"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give  his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I\\'d given one man, and thought it  too much, while he gave four, without grudging them. I had all my girls  to comfort me at home; and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say  \\'good by\\' to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy, thinking of my  blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and  thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\"    \"Tell another story, mother,--one with a moral to it, like this. I like  to think about them afterwards, if they are real, and not too preachy,\"  said Jo, after a minute\\'s silence.    Mrs. March smiled, and began at once; for she had told stories to this  little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.    \"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and  drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and  parents, who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.\" (Here  the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew  diligently.) \"These girls were anxious to be good, and made many  excellent resolutions; but they did not keep them very well, and were  constantly saying, \\'If we only had this,\\' or \\'If we could only do that,\\'  quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many pleasant things  they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could  use to make them happy, and she said, \\'When you feel discontented, think  over your blessings, and be grateful.\\'\" (Here Jo looked up quickly, as  if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not  done yet.)    \"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were  surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money  couldn\\'t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people\\'s houses; another  that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth,  health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady, who  couldn\\'t enjoy her comforts; a third that, disagreeable as it was to  help get dinner, it was harder still to have to go begging for it; and  the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good  behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings  already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken  away entirely, instead of increased; and I believe they were never  disappointed, or sorry that they took the old woman\\'s advice.\"    \"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories  against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!\" cried Meg.    \"I like that kind of sermon. It\\'s the sort father used to tell us,\" said  Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo\\'s cushion.    \"I don\\'t complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more  careful than ever now; for I\\'ve had warning from Susie\\'s downfall,\" said  Amy morally.    \"We needed that lesson, and we won\\'t forget it. If we do, you just say  to us, as old Chloe did in \\'Uncle Tom,\\' \\'Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!  tink ob yer marcies!\\'\" added Jo, who could not, for the life of her,  help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took  it to heart as much as any of them.                         [Illustration: Tail-piece]                                             V.                               BEING NEIGHBORLY.                          [Illustration: Being neighborly]    \"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?\" asked Meg, one snowy  afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber  boots, old sack and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the  other.    \"Going out for exercise,\" answered Jo, with a mischievous twinkle in her  eyes.    \"I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It\\'s  cold and dull out; and I advise you to stay, warm and dry, by the fire,  as I do,\" said Meg, with a shiver.    \"Never take advice! Can\\'t keep still all day, and, not being a pussycat,  I don\\'t like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I\\'m going to  find some.\"    Meg went back to toast her feet and read \"Ivanhoe\"; and Jo began to dig  paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon  swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came  out; and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the  Marches\\' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the  city, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large  gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one  side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of  the vines that in summer covered its walls, and the flowers which then  surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly  betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach-house  and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely  things one caught between the rich curtains. Yet it seemed a lonely,  lifeless sort of house; for no children frolicked on the lawn, no  motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and  out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.    To Jo\\'s lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace,  full of splendors and delights, which no one enjoyed. She had long  wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the \"Laurence boy,\"  who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to  begin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had  planned many ways of making friends with him; but he had not been seen  lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a  brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden,  where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.    \"That boy is suffering for society and fun,\" she said to herself. \"His  grandpa does not know what\\'s good for him, and keeps him shut up all  alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young  and lively. I\\'ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!\"    The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things, and was always  scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of \"going over\" was  not forgotten; and when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try  what could be done. She saw Mr. Laurence drive off, and then sallied out  to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused, and took a survey.  All quiet,--curtains down at the lower windows; servants out of sight,  and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand  at the upper window.    \"There he is,\" thought Jo, \"poor boy! all alone and sick this dismal  day. It\\'s a shame! I\\'ll toss up a snow-ball, and make him look out, and  then say a kind word to him.\"    Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a  face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes  brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and  flourished her broom as she called out,--    \"How do you do? Are you sick?\"                    [Illustration: Laurie opened the window]    Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven,--    \"Better, thank you. I\\'ve had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\"    \"I\\'m sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?\"    \"Nothing; it\\'s as dull as tombs up here.\"    \"Don\\'t you read?\"    \"Not much; they won\\'t let me.\"    \"Can\\'t somebody read to you?\"    \"Grandpa does, sometimes; but my books don\\'t interest him, and I hate to  ask Brooke all the time.\"    \"Have some one come and see you, then.\"    \"There isn\\'t any one I\\'d like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head  is weak.\"    \"Isn\\'t there some nice girl who\\'d read and amuse you? Girls are quiet,  and like to play nurse.\"    \"Don\\'t know any.\"    \"You know us,\" began Jo, then laughed, and stopped.    \"So I do! Will you come, please?\" cried Laurie.    \"I\\'m not quiet and nice; but I\\'ll come, if mother will let me. I\\'ll go  ask her. Shut that window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\"    With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering  what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at  the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready; for, as Mrs.  March said, he was \"a little gentleman,\" and did honor to the coming  guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh collar, and trying  to tidy up the room, which, in spite of half a dozen servants, was  anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided  voice, asking for \"Mr. Laurie,\" and a surprised-looking servant came  running up to announce a young lady.    \"All right, show her up, it\\'s Miss Jo,\" said Laurie, going to the door  of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and kind and  quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth\\'s three  kittens in the other.    \"Here I am, bag and baggage,\" she said briskly. \"Mother sent her love,  and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some  of her blanc-mange; she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats  would be comforting. I knew you\\'d laugh at them, but I couldn\\'t refuse,  she was so anxious to do something.\"    It so happened that Beth\\'s funny loan was just the thing; for, in  laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable  at once.    \"That looks too pretty to eat,\" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo  uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc-mange, surrounded by a garland  of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy\\'s pet geranium.    \"It isn\\'t anything, only they all felt kindly, and wanted to show it.  Tell the girl to put it away for your tea: it\\'s so simple, you can eat  it; and, being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.  What a cosy room this is!\"    \"It might be if it was kept nice; but the maids are lazy, and I don\\'t  know how to make them mind. It worries me, though.\"    \"I\\'ll right it up in two minutes; for it only needs to have the hearth  brushed, so,--and the things made straight on the mantel-piece so,--and  the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the  light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now, then, you\\'re fixed.\"    And so he was; for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things  into place, and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched  her in respectful silence; and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat  down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully,--    \"How kind you are! Yes, that\\'s what it wanted. Now please take the big  chair, and let me do something to amuse my company.\"    \"No; I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?\" and Jo looked  affectionately toward some inviting books near by.    \"Thank you; I\\'ve read all those, and if you don\\'t mind, I\\'d rather  talk,\" answered Laurie.    \"Not a bit; I\\'ll talk all day if you\\'ll only set me going. Beth says I  never know when to stop.\"    \"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home a good deal, and sometimes goes  out with a little basket?\" asked Laurie, with interest.    \"Yes, that\\'s Beth; she\\'s my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\"    \"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\"    \"How did you find that out?\"    Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, \"Why, you see, I often hear you  calling to one another, and when I\\'m alone up here, I can\\'t help looking  over at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg  your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the  curtain at the window where the flowers are; and when the lamps are  lighted, it\\'s like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all  round the table with your mother; her face is right opposite, and it  looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can\\'t help watching it. I haven\\'t  got any mother, you know;\" and Laurie poked the fire to hide a little  twitching of the lips that he could not control.    The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo\\'s warm heart.  She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,  and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was  sick and lonely; and, feeling how rich she was in home-love and  happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very  friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said,--    \"We\\'ll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as  much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you\\'d come  over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she\\'d do you heaps of good, and  Beth would sing to you if _I_ begged her to, and Amy would dance; Meg  and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we\\'d  have jolly times. Wouldn\\'t your grandpa let you?\"    \"I think he would, if your mother asked him. He\\'s very kind, though he  does not look so; and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he\\'s  afraid I might be a bother to strangers,\" began Laurie, brightening more  and more.    \"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn\\'t think you\\'d be  a bother. We _want_ to know you, and I\\'ve been trying to do it this ever  so long. We haven\\'t been here a great while, you know, but we have got  acquainted with all our neighbors but you.\"    \"You see grandpa lives among his books, and doesn\\'t mind much what  happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn\\'t stay here, you know, and  I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as  I can.\"    \"That\\'s bad. You ought to make an effort, and go visiting everywhere you  are asked; then you\\'ll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go  to. Never mind being bashful; it won\\'t last long if you keep going.\"    Laurie turned red again, but wasn\\'t offended at being accused of  bashfulness; for there was so much good-will in Jo, it was impossible  not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.    \"Do you like your school?\" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a  little pause, during which he stared at the fire, and Jo looked about  her, well pleased.    \"Don\\'t go to school; I\\'m a business man--girl, I mean. I go to wait on  my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\" answered Jo.    Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question; but remembering just in  time that it wasn\\'t manners to make too many inquiries into people\\'s  affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. Jo liked his good  breeding, and didn\\'t mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him  a lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot  that talked Spanish, and the library where she revelled. Laurie enjoyed  that immensely; and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came  once to woo Aunt March, and, in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll  had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and  laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head  in to see what was the matter.                    [Illustration: Poll tweaked off his wig]    \"Oh! that does me no end of good. Tell on, please,\" he said, taking his  face out of the sofa-cushion, red and shining with merriment.    Much elated with her success, Jo did \"tell on,\" all about their plays  and plans, their hopes and fears for father, and the most interesting  events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to  talking about books; and to Jo\\'s delight, she found that Laurie loved  them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.    \"If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandpa is out, so  you needn\\'t be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.    \"I\\'m not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.    \"I don\\'t believe you are!\" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much  admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be  a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his  moods.    The atmosphere of the whole house being summer-like, Laurie led the way  from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy;  and so at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands,  and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined  with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little  cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and sleepy-hollow chairs, and  queer tables, and bronzes; and, best of all, a great open fireplace,  with quaint tiles all round it.    \"What richness!\" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair,  and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \"Theodore  Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added  impressively.    \"A fellow can\\'t live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head, as he  perched on a table opposite.    Before he could say more, a bell rung, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with  alarm, \"Mercy me! it\\'s your grandpa!\"    \"Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"  returned the boy, looking wicked.    \"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don\\'t know why I should  be. Marmee said I might come, and I don\\'t think you\\'re any the worse for  it,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.    \"I\\'m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I\\'m only  afraid you are very tired talking to me; it was _so_ pleasant, I  couldn\\'t bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.    \"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.    \"Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,\"  said Laurie.    \"Don\\'t mind me. I\\'m as happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.    Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was  standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman, when the door  opened again, and, without turning, she said decidedly, \"I\\'m sure now  that I shouldn\\'t be afraid of him, for he\\'s got kind eyes, though his  mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.  He isn\\'t as handsome as _my_ grandfather, but I like him.\"    \"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her; and there, to her  great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.    Poor Jo blushed till she couldn\\'t blush any redder, and her heart began  to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a  minute a wild desire to run away possessed her; but that was cowardly,  and the girls would laugh at her: so she resolved to stay, and get out  of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living  eyes, under the bushy gray eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted  ones; and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a  good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman  said abruptly, after that dreadful pause, \"So you\\'re not afraid of me,  hey?\"    \"Not much, sir.\"    \"And you don\\'t think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"    \"Not quite, sir.\"    \"And I\\'ve got a tremendous will, have I?\"    \"I only said I thought so.\"    \"But you like me, in spite of it?\"    \"Yes, I do, sir.\"    That answer pleased the old gentleman; he gave a short laugh, shook  hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her  face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying, with a nod, \"You\\'ve  got your grandfather\\'s spirit, if you haven\\'t his face. He _was_ a fine  man, my dear; but, what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and  I was proud to be his friend.\"               [Illustration: Putting his finger under her chin]    \"Thank you, sir;\" and Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited  her exactly.    \"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\" was the next  question, sharply put.    \"Only trying to be neighborly, sir;\" and Jo told how her visit came  about.    \"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"    \"Yes, sir; he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good  perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,  for we don\\'t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said Jo  eagerly.    \"Tut, tut, tut! that was the boy\\'s affair. How is the poor woman?\"    \"Doing nicely, sir;\" and off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all  about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than  they were.    \"Just her father\\'s way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother  some fine day. Tell her so. There\\'s the tea-bell; we have it early, on  the boy\\'s account. Come down, and go on being neighborly.\"    \"If you\\'d like to have me, sir.\"    \"Shouldn\\'t ask you, if I didn\\'t;\" and Mr. Laurence offered her his arm  with old-fashioned courtesy.    \"What _would_ Meg say to this?\" thought Jo, as she was marched away,  while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story  at home.    \"Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\" said the old  gentleman, as Laurie came running down stairs, and brought up with a  start of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm-in-arm with his  redoubtable grandfather.    \"I didn\\'t know you\\'d come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant  little glance.    \"That\\'s evident, by the way you racket down stairs. Come to your tea,  sir, and behave like a gentleman;\" and having pulled the boy\\'s hair by  way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a  series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an  explosion of laughter from Jo.    The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but  he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and  the change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light,  and life in the boy\\'s face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine  merriment in his laugh.    \"She\\'s right; the lad _is_ lonely. I\\'ll see what these little girls can  do for him,\" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked  Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him; and she seemed to understand the  boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.    If the Laurences had been what Jo called \"prim and poky,\" she would not  have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward; but  finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good  impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had  something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which  had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as  she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either  side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and  trees that hung above her,--while her new friend cut the finest flowers  till his hands were full; then he tied them up, saying, with the happy  look Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your mother, and tell her I  like the medicine she sent me very much.\"                [Illustration: Please give these to your mother]    They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great  drawing-room, but Jo\\'s attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano,  which stood open.    \"Do you play?\" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful  expression.    \"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.    \"Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\"    \"Won\\'t you first?\"    \"Don\\'t know how; too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\"    So Laurie played, and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in  heliotrope and tea-roses. Her respect and regard for the \"Laurence boy\"  increased very much, for he played remarkably well, and didn\\'t put on  any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so; only  praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to the  rescue. \"That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugar-plums  are not good for him. His music isn\\'t bad, but I hope he will do as well  in more important things. Going? Well, I\\'m much obliged to you, and I  hope you\\'ll come again. My respects to your mother. Good-night, Doctor  Jo.\"    He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.  When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said anything  amiss. He shook his head.    \"No, it was me; he doesn\\'t like to hear me play.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"I\\'ll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can\\'t.\"    \"No need of that; I am not a young lady, and it\\'s only a step. Take care  of yourself, won\\'t you?\"    \"Yes; but you will come again, I hope?\"    \"If you promise to come and see us after you are well.\"    \"I will.\"    \"Good-night, Laurie!\"    \"Good-night, Jo, good-night!\"    When all the afternoon\\'s adventures had been told, the family felt  inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very  attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March  wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him;  Meg longed to walk in the conservatory; Beth sighed for the grand piano;  and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.    \"Mother, why didn\\'t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\" asked Jo,  who was of an inquiring disposition.    \"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie\\'s father,  married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who  is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did  not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died  when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home.  I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old  man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes  naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare  say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician; at any  rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he  \\'glowered,\\' as Jo said.\"    \"Dear me, how romantic!\" exclaimed Meg.    \"How silly!\" said Jo. \"Let him be a musician, if he wants to, and not  plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\"    \"That\\'s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I  suppose. Italians are always nice,\" said Meg, who was a little  sentimental.    \"What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to  him, hardly,\" cried Jo, who was _not_ sentimental.    \"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to  behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent  him.\"    \"He meant the blanc-mange, I suppose.\"    \"How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.\"    \"Did he?\" and Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her  before.    \"I never saw such a girl! You don\\'t know a compliment when you get it,\"  said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.    \"I think they are great nonsense, and I\\'ll thank you not to be silly,  and spoil my fun. Laurie\\'s a nice boy, and I like him, and I won\\'t have  any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We\\'ll all be  good to him, because he hasn\\'t got any mother, and he _may_ come over  and see us, mayn\\'t he, Marmee?\"    \"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will  remember that children should be children as long as they can.\"    \"I don\\'t call myself a child, and I\\'m not in my teens yet,\" observed  Amy. \"What do you say, Beth?\"    \"I was thinking about our \\'Pilgrim\\'s Progress,\\'\" answered Beth, who had  not heard a word. \"How we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket  Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying; and that  maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our  Palace Beautiful.\"    \"We have got to get by the lions, first,\" said Jo, as if she rather  liked the prospect.                           [Illustration: Tail-piece]                                            VI.                        BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL.      The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for  all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr.  Laurence was the biggest one; but after he had called, said something  funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with  their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The  other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich; for this  made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But,  after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and  could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March\\'s  motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in  that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride, and  interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.    All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time; for the new  friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and  he privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly  splendid girls.\" With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the  solitary boy into their midst, and made much of him, and he found  something very charming in the innocent companionship of these  simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick  to feel the influences they brought about him; and their busy, lively  ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of  books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged  to make very unsatisfactory reports; for Laurie was always playing  truant, and running over to the Marches.    \"Never mind; let him take a holiday, and make it up afterwards,\" said  the old gentleman. \"The good lady next door says he is studying too  hard, and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is  right, and that I\\'ve been coddling the fellow as if I\\'d been his  grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can\\'t  get into mischief in that little nunnery over there; and Mrs. March is  doing more for him than we can.\"    What good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such  sleigh-rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old  parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg  could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in  bouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the  old gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed  beauty to her heart\\'s content; and Laurie played \"lord of the manor\" in  the most delightful style.    But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up  courage to go to the \"Mansion of Bliss,\" as Meg called it. She went once  with Jo; but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared  at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \"Hey!\" so loud,  that he frightened her so much her \"feet chattered on the floor,\" she  told her mother; and she ran away, declaring she would never go there  any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements  could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence\\'s ear in  some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the  brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and  talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had  heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to  stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if  fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped, and stood listening,  with her great eyes wide open, and her cheeks red with the excitement of  this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had  been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie\\'s lessons and teachers;  and presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs.  March,--    \"The boy neglects his music now, and I\\'m glad of it, for he was getting  too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn\\'t some of  your girls like to run over, and practise on it now and then, just to  keep it in tune, you know, ma\\'am?\"    Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep  from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation; and the  thought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath  away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd  little nod and smile,--    \"They needn\\'t see or speak to any one, but run in at any time; for I\\'m  shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great  deal, and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine  o\\'clock.\"    Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that  last arrangement left nothing to be desired. \"Please tell the young  ladies what I say; and if they don\\'t care to come, why, never mind.\"  Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a  face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way,--    \"O sir, they do care, very, very much!\"                 [Illustration: O sir, they do care very much]    \"Are you the musical girl?\" he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\" as he  looked down at her very kindly.    \"I\\'m Beth. I love it dearly, and I\\'ll come, if you are quite sure nobody  will hear me--and be disturbed,\" she added, fearing to be rude, and  trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.    \"Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come, and drum  away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"    \"How kind you are, sir!\"    Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was  not frightened now, and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze, because  she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.  The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,  stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard,--    \"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear!  Good day, madam;\" and away he went, in a great hurry.    Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the  glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not at home.  How blithely she sung that evening, and how they all laughed at her,  because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in  her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of  the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the  side-door, and made her way, as noiselessly as any mouse, to the  drawing-room, where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some  pretty, easy music lay on the piano; and, with trembling fingers, and  frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great  instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything  else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was  like the voice of a beloved friend.    She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no  appetite, and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state  of beatitude.    After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every  day, and the great drawing-room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that  came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his  study-door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie  mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away; she never suspected  that the exercise-books and new songs which she found in the rack were  put there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about  music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that  helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what  isn\\'t always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.  Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a  greater was given her; at any rate, she deserved both.            [Illustration: Mr. Laurence often opened his study door]    \"Mother, I\\'m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so  kind to me, I must thank him, and I don\\'t know any other way. Can I do  it?\" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.    \"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking  him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making  up,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth\\'s  requests, because she so seldom asked anything for herself.    After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,  the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet  cheerful pansies, on a deeper purple ground, was pronounced very  appropriate and pretty; and Beth worked away early and late, with  occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needle-woman,  and they were finished before any one got tired of them. Then she wrote  a very short, simple note, and, with Laurie\\'s help, got them smuggled on  to the study-table one morning before the old gentleman was up.    When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All  that day passed, and a part of the next, before any acknowledgment  arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety  friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an  errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As  she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four, heads  popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,  several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed,--    \"Here\\'s a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!\"    \"O Beth, he\\'s sent you--\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy;  but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.    Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door, her sisters  seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all  pointing, and all saying at once, \"Look there! look there!\" Beth did  look, and turned pale with delight and surprise; for there stood a  little cabinet-piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed,  like a sign-board, to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\"    \"For me?\" gasped Beth, holding on to Jo, and feeling as if she should  tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.    \"Yes; all for you, my precious! Isn\\'t it splendid of him? Don\\'t you  think he\\'s the dearest old man in the world? Here\\'s the key in the  letter. We didn\\'t open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\" cried  Jo, hugging her sister, and offering the note.    \"You read it! I can\\'t, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!\" and Beth  hid her face in Jo\\'s apron, quite upset by her present.    Jo opened the paper, and began to laugh, for the first words she saw  were,--        \"MISS MARCH:            \"_Dear Madam_,--\"    \"How nice it sounds! I wish some one would write to me so!\" said Amy,  who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.        \"\\'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had      any that suited me so well as yours,\\'\" continued Jo.      \"\\'Heart\\'s-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always      remind me of the gentle giver. I like to pay my debts; so I      know you will allow \"the old gentleman\" to send you something      which once belonged to the little granddaughter he lost. With      hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain,        \"\\'Your grateful friend and humble servant,                                            \"\\'JAMES LAURENCE.\\'\"    \"There, Beth, that\\'s an honor to be proud of, I\\'m sure! Laurie told me  how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept  all her little things carefully. Just think, he\\'s given you her piano.  That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\" said Jo, trying to  soothe Beth, who trembled, and looked more excited than she had ever  been before.    \"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,  puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and  stool, all complete,\" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying  its beauties.    \"\\'Your humble servant, James Laurence\\'; only think of his writing that  to you. I\\'ll tell the girls. They\\'ll think it\\'s splendid,\" said Amy,  much impressed by the note.    \"Try it, honey. Let\\'s hear the sound of the baby-pianny,\" said Hannah,  who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.    So Beth tried it; and every one pronounced it the most remarkable piano  ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie  order; but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm of it lay in the  happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly  touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright  pedals.    \"You\\'ll have to go and thank him,\" said Jo, by way of a joke; for the  idea of the child\\'s really going never entered her head.    \"Yes, I mean to. I guess I\\'ll go now, before I get frightened thinking  about it.\" And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth  walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the  Laurences\\' door.    \"Well, I wish I may die if it ain\\'t the queerest thing I ever see! The  pianny has turned her head! She\\'d never have gone in her right mind,\"  cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite  speechless by the miracle.    They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did  afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the  study-door before she gave herself time to think; and when a gruff voice  called out, \"Come in!\" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who  looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a  small quaver in her voice, \"I came to thank you, sir, for--\" But she  didn\\'t finish; for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech,  and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put  both arms round his neck, and kissed him.        [Illustration: She put both arms around his neck and kissed him]    If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman  wouldn\\'t have been more astonished; but he liked it,--oh, dear, yes, he  liked it amazingly!--and was so touched and pleased by that confiding  little kiss that all his crustiness vanished; and he just set her on his  knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he  had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him  from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cosily as if she had  known him all her life; for love casts out fear, and gratitude can  conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate,  shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again,  looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old  gentleman, as he was.    When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of  expressing her satisfaction; Amy nearly fell out of the window in her  surprise; and Meg exclaimed, with uplifted hands, \"Well, I do believe  the world is coming to an end!\"                                            VII.                          AMY\\'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.                            [Illustration: The Cyclops]    \"That boy is a perfect Cyclops, isn\\'t he?\" said Amy, one day, as Laurie  clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.    \"How dare you say so, when he\\'s got both his eyes? and very handsome  ones they are, too,\" cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about  her friend.    \"I didn\\'t say anything about his eyes, and I don\\'t see why you need fire  up when I admire his riding.\"    \"Oh, my goodness! that little goose means a centaur, and she called him  a Cyclops,\" exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.    \"You needn\\'t be so rude; it\\'s only a \\'lapse of lingy,\\' as Mr. Davis  says,\" retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. \"I just wish I had a  little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,\" she added, as if to  herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.    \"Why?\" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy\\'s  second blunder.    \"I need it so much; I\\'m dreadfully in debt, and it won\\'t be my turn to  have the rag-money for a month.\"    \"In debt, Amy? What do you mean?\" and Meg looked sober.    \"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can\\'t pay them, you  know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged  at the shop.\"    \"Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking  bits of rubber to make balls;\" and Meg tried to keep her countenance,  Amy looked so grave and important.    \"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to  be thought mean, you must do it, too. It\\'s nothing but limes now, for  every one is sucking them in their desks in school-time, and trading  them off for pencils, bead-rings, paper dolls, or something else, at  recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime; if she\\'s mad  with her, she eats one before her face, and don\\'t offer even a suck.  They treat by turns; and I\\'ve had ever so many, but haven\\'t returned  them; and I ought, for they are debts of honor, you know.\"    \"How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?\" asked Meg, taking  out her purse.    \"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat  for you. Don\\'t you like limes?\"    \"Not much; you may have my share. Here\\'s the money. Make it last as long  as you can, for it isn\\'t very plenty, you know.\"    \"Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket-money! I\\'ll have a  grand feast, for I haven\\'t tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate  about taking any, as I couldn\\'t return them, and I\\'m actually suffering  for one.\"    Next day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the  temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper  parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.  During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four  delicious limes (she ate one on the way), and was going to treat,  circulated through her \"set,\" and the attentions of her friends became  quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the  spot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and  Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her  limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet, and offered to furnish  answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow\\'s  cutting remarks about \"some persons whose noses were not too flat to  smell other people\\'s limes, and stuck-up people, who were not too proud  to ask for them;\" and she instantly crushed \"that Snow girl\\'s\" hopes by  the withering telegram, \"You needn\\'t be so polite all of a sudden, for  you won\\'t get any.\"    A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and  Amy\\'s beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe  rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the  airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! pride goes before a  fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success.  No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed  himself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important question,  informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her  desk.    Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly  vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the  law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after  a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and  newspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden  distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that  one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys  are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows! but girls are  infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen, with tyrannical  tempers, and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis  knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, Algebra, and ologies of all sorts, so  he was called a fine teacher; and manners, morals, feelings, and  examples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most  unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had  evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an east  wind, which always affected his neuralgia; and his pupils had not done  him the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the  expressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl, \"he was as  nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear.\" The word \"limes\" was like  fire to powder; his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with  an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.    \"Young ladies, attention, if you please!\"    At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,  gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.    \"Miss March, come to the desk.\"    Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed  her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.    \"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,\" was the unexpected  command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.    \"Don\\'t take all,\" whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence  of mind.    Amy hastily shook out half a dozen, and laid the rest down before Mr.  Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when  that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis  particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust  added to his wrath.    \"Is that all?\"    \"Not quite,\" stammered Amy.    \"Bring the rest immediately.\"    With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.    \"You are sure there are no more?\"    \"I never lie, sir.\"    \"So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them  out of the window.\"    There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the  last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.  Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times;  and as each doomed couple--looking oh! so plump and juicy--fell from her  reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the  girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the  little Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This--this was too  much; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable  Davis, and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.    As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \"Hem!\"  and said, in his most impressive manner,--    \"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry  this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I  _never_ break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.\"    Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring  look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.  She was rather a favorite with \"old Davis,\" as, of course, he was  called, and it\\'s my private belief that he _would_ have broken his word  if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in  a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman,  and sealed the culprit\\'s fate.    \"Your hand, Miss March!\" was the only answer her mute appeal received;  and, too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her  head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her  little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no  difference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck;  and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her  down.       [Illustration: Amy bore without flinching several tingling blows]    \"You will now stand on the platform till recess,\" said Mr. Davis,  resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.    That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and  see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few  enemies; but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,  seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop  down where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of  wrong, and the thought of Jenny Snow, helped her to bear it; and, taking  the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove-funnel above what  now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that  the girls found it very hard to study, with that pathetic figure before  them.    During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little  girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it  might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard  experience; for during the twelve years of her life she had been  governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her  before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten  in the sting of the thought,--    \"I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!\"    The fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end at last, and  the word \"Recess!\" had never seemed so welcome to her before.    \"You can go, Miss March,\" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,  uncomfortable.    He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went,  without a word to any one, straight into the ante-room, snatched her  things, and left the place \"forever,\" as she passionately declared to  herself. She was in a sad state when she got home; and when the older  girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at  once. Mrs. March did not say much, but looked disturbed, and comforted  her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the  insulted hand with glycerine and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved  kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this; Jo wrathfully  proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; and Hannah shook her  fist at the \"villain,\" and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him  under her pestle.    No notice was taken of Amy\\'s flight, except by her mates; but the  sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in  the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo  appeared, wearing a grim expression, as she stalked up to the desk, and  delivered a letter from her mother; then collected Amy\\'s property, and  departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as  if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.    \"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a  little every day, with Beth,\" said Mrs. March, that evening. \"I don\\'t  approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr.  Davis\\'s manner of teaching, and don\\'t think the girls you associate with  are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father\\'s advice before I  send you anywhere else.\"    \"That\\'s good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old  school. It\\'s perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\" sighed  Amy, with the air of a martyr.    \"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved  some punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather  disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.    \"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"  cried Amy.    \"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her  mother; \"but I\\'m not sure that it won\\'t do you more good than a milder  method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite  time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and  virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the  finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness  will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing  and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power  is modesty.\"    \"So it is!\" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. \"I  knew a girl, once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she  didn\\'t know it; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when  she was alone, and wouldn\\'t have believed it if any one had told her.\"    \"I wish I\\'d known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I\\'m so  stupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.    \"You do know her, and she helps you better than any one else could,\"  answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his  merry black eyes, that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face  in the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.                        [Illustration: You do know her]    Jo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her Beth, who  could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So  Laurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly  lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his  character. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,  said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--    \"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?\"    \"Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will  make a fine man, if not spoilt by petting,\" replied her mother.    \"And he isn\\'t conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.    \"Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so  much.\"    \"I see; it\\'s nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to  show off, or get perked up,\" said Amy thoughtfully.    \"These things are always seen and felt in a person\\'s manner and  conversation, if modestly used; but it is not necessary to display  them,\" said Mrs. March.    \"Any more than it\\'s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and  ribbons at once, that folks may know you\\'ve got them,\" added Jo; and the  lecture ended in a laugh.                        [Illustration: Girls, where are you going?]                                     VIII.                               JO MEETS APOLLYON.      \"Girls, where are you going?\" asked Amy, coming into their room one  Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out, with an  air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.    \"Never mind; little girls shouldn\\'t ask questions,\" returned Jo sharply.    Now if there _is_ anything mortifying to our feelings, when we are  young, it is to be told that; and to be bidden to \"run away, dear,\" is  still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined  to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who  never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \"Do tell me! I  should think you might let me go, too; for Beth is fussing over her  piano, and I haven\\'t got anything to do, and am _so_ lonely.\"    \"I can\\'t, dear, because you aren\\'t invited,\" began Meg; but Jo broke in  impatiently, \"Now, Meg, be quiet, or you will spoil it all. You can\\'t  go, Amy; so don\\'t be a baby, and whine about it.\"    \"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are; you were  whispering and laughing together, on the sofa, last night, and you  stopped when I came in. Aren\\'t you going with him?\"    \"Yes, we are; now do be still, and stop bothering.\"    Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her  pocket.    \"I know! I know! you\\'re going to the theatre to see the \\'Seven  Castles!\\'\" she cried; adding resolutely, \"and I _shall_ go, for mother  said I might see it; and I\\'ve got my rag-money, and it was mean not to  tell me in time.\"    \"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\" said Meg soothingly.  \"Mother doesn\\'t wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well  enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go  with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\"    \"I don\\'t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let  me; I\\'ve been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I\\'m dying for  some fun. Do, Meg! I\\'ll be ever so good,\" pleaded Amy, looking as  pathetic as she could.    \"Suppose we take her. I don\\'t believe mother would mind, if we bundle  her up well,\" began Meg.    \"If _she_ goes _I_ sha\\'n\\'t; and if I don\\'t, Laurie won\\'t like it; and it  will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I  should think she\\'d hate to poke herself where she isn\\'t wanted,\" said Jo  crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child,  when she wanted to enjoy herself.    Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,  in her most aggravating way, \"I _shall_ go; Meg says I may; and if I pay  for myself, Laurie hasn\\'t anything to do with it.\"    \"You can\\'t sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn\\'t sit  alone; so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our  pleasure; or he\\'ll get another seat for you, and that isn\\'t proper, when  you weren\\'t asked. You sha\\'n\\'t stir a step; so you may just stay where  you are,\" scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger  in her hurry.    Sitting on the floor, with one boot on, Amy began to cry, and Meg to  reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls  hurried down, leaving their sister wailing; for now and then she forgot  her grown-up ways, and acted like a spoilt child. Just as the party was  setting out, Amy called over the banisters, in a threatening tone,  \"You\\'ll be sorry for this, Jo March; see if you ain\\'t.\"    \"Fiddlesticks!\" returned Jo, slamming the door.    They had a charming time, for \"The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake\"  were as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But, in spite of  the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and gorgeous princes and  princesses, Jo\\'s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it; the fairy  queen\\'s yellow curls reminded her of Amy; and between the acts she  amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her  \"sorry for it.\" She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course  of their lives, for both had quick tempers, and were apt to be violent  when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and  semi-occasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed  afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had  hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting  her into trouble; her anger never lasted long, and, having humbly  confessed her fault, she sincerely repented, and tried to do better. Her  sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury,  because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be  good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her;  and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.    When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an  injured air as they came in; never lifted her eyes from her book, or  asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered  resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire, and receive a glowing  description of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo\\'s  first look was toward the bureau; for, in their last quarrel, Amy had  soothed her feelings by turning Jo\\'s top drawer upside down on the  floor. Everything was in its place, however; and after a hasty glance  into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had  forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.    There Jo was mistaken; for next day she made a discovery which produced  a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the  afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited, and demanding  breathlessly, \"Has any one taken my book?\"    Meg and Beth said \"No,\" at once, and looked surprised; Amy poked the  fire, and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise, and was down upon her in  a minute.    \"Amy, you\\'ve got it?\"    \"No, I haven\\'t.\"    \"You know where it is, then?\"    \"No, I don\\'t.\"    \"That\\'s a fib!\" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking  fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.    \"It isn\\'t. I haven\\'t got it, don\\'t know where it is now, and don\\'t  care.\"    \"You know something about it, and you\\'d better tell at once, or I\\'ll  make you,\" and Jo gave her a slight shake.    \"Scold as much as you like, you\\'ll never see your silly old book again,\"  cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.    \"Why not?\"    \"I burnt it up.\"                         [Illustration: I burnt it up]    \"What! my little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to  finish before father got home? Have you really burnt it?\" said Jo,  turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy  nervously.    \"Yes, I did! I told you I\\'d make you pay for being so cross yesterday,  and I have, so--\"    Amy got no farther, for Jo\\'s hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy  till her teeth chattered in her head; crying, in a passion of grief and  anger,--    \"You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I\\'ll never  forgive you as long as I live.\"    Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside  herself; and, with a parting box on her sister\\'s ear, she rushed out of  the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.    The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard  the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her  sister. Jo\\'s book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her  family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen  little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her  whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to  print. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the  old manuscript, so that Amy\\'s bonfire had consumed the loving work of  several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a  dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.  Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her  pet; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would  love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted  more than any of them.    When the tea-bell rung, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable  that it took all Amy\\'s courage to say meekly,--    \"Please forgive me, Jo; I\\'m very, very sorry.\"    \"I never shall forgive you,\" was Jo\\'s stern answer; and, from that  moment, she ignored Amy entirely.    No one spoke of the great trouble,--not even Mrs. March,--for all had  learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted;  and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own  generous nature, softened Jo\\'s resentment, and healed the breach. It was  not a happy evening; for, though they sewed as usual, while their mother  read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and  the sweet home-peace was disturbed. They felt this most when  singing-time came; for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone,  and Amy broke down, so Meg and mother sung alone. But, in spite of their  efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flute-like voices did not seem to  chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.    As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,--    \"My dear, don\\'t let the sun go down upon your anger; forgive each other,  help each other, and begin again to-morrow.\"    Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief  and anger all away; but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so  deeply injured that she really _couldn\\'t_ quite forgive yet. So she  winked hard, shook her head, and said, gruffly because Amy was  listening,--    \"It was an abominable thing, and she don\\'t deserve to be forgiven.\"    With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential  gossip that night.    Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and  began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured than  ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was  particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder-cloud, and  nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning; she  dropped her precious turn-over in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack  of fidgets, Meg was pensive, Beth _would_ look grieved and wistful when  she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always  talking about being good, and yet wouldn\\'t try, when other people set  them a virtuous example.    \"Everybody is so hateful, I\\'ll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always  kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,\" said Jo to herself,  and off she went.    Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient  exclamation,--    \"There! she promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we  shall have. But it\\'s no use to ask such a cross-patch to take me.\"    \"Don\\'t say that; you _were_ very naughty, and it _is_ hard to forgive  the loss of her precious little book; but I think she might do it now,  and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,\" said Meg. \"Go  after them; don\\'t say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie,  then take a quiet minute, and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and  I\\'m sure she\\'ll be friends again, with all her heart.\"    \"I\\'ll try,\" said Amy, for the advice suited her; and, after a flurry to  get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over  the hill.    It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached  them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back; Laurie did not see, for he  was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm  spell had preceded the cold snap.    \"I\\'ll go on to the first bend, and see if it\\'s all right, before we  begin to race,\" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young  Russian, in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.    Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing her  fingers, as she tried to put her skates on; but Jo never turned, and  went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of  satisfaction in her sister\\'s troubles. She had cherished her anger till  it grew strong, and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and  feelings always do, unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend,  he shouted back,--    \"Keep near the shore; it isn\\'t safe in the middle.\"    Jo heard, but Amy was just struggling to her feet, and did not catch a  word. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was  harboring said in her ear,--    \"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.\"    Laurie had vanished round the bend; Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,  far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the  river. For a minute Jo stood still, with a strange feeling at her heart;  then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round,  just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with the sudden  crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo\\'s heart  stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone;  she tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in  them; and, for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring, with  a terror-stricken face, at the little blue hood above the black water.  Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie\\'s voice cried out,--    \"Bring a rail; quick, quick!\"    How she did it, she never knew; but for the next few minutes she worked  as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,  and, lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey till Jo dragged a  rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more  frightened than hurt.               [Illustration: Held Amy up by his arms and hockey]    \"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can; pile our things on  her, while I get off these confounded skates,\" cried Laurie, wrapping  his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps, which never seemed  so intricate before.    Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home; and, after an  exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets, before a hot  fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken; but flown about, looking  pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands  cut and bruised by ice and rails, and refractory buckles. When Amy was  comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed,  she called Jo to her, and began to bind up the hurt hands.    \"Are you sure she is safe?\" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the  golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever  under the treacherous ice.    \"Quite safe, dear; she is not hurt, and won\\'t even take cold, I think,  you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,\" replied  her mother cheerfully.    \"Laurie did it all; I only let her go. Mother, if she _should_ die, it  would be my fault\"; and Jo dropped down beside the bed, in a passion of  penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her  hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the  heavy punishment which might have come upon her.    \"It\\'s my dreadful temper! I try to cure it; I think I have, and then it  breaks out worse than ever. O mother, what shall I do? what shall I do?\"  cried poor Jo, in despair.    \"Watch and pray, dear; never get tired of trying; and never think it is  impossible to conquer your fault,\" said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy  head to her shoulder, and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo  cried harder than ever.    \"You don\\'t know, you can\\'t guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could  do anything when I\\'m in a passion; I get so savage, I could hurt any  one, and enjoy it. I\\'m afraid I _shall_ do something dreadful some day,  and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. O mother, help me, do  help me!\"    \"I will, my child, I will. Don\\'t cry so bitterly, but remember this day,  and resolve, with all your soul, that you will never know another like  it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours,  and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your  temper is the worst in the world; but mine used to be just like it.\"    \"Yours, mother? Why, you are never angry!\" and, for the moment, Jo  forgot remorse in surprise.    \"I\\'ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in  controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have  learned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though  it may take me another forty years to do so.\"    The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better  lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. She felt  comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her; the  knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,  made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it;  though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray, to a  girl of fifteen.    \"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together, and go  out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds, or people worry  you?\" asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever  before.    \"Yes, I\\'ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips; and  when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away  a minute, and give myself a little shake, for being so weak and wicked,\"  answered Mrs. March, with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and  fastened up Jo\\'s dishevelled hair.    \"How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me--for the  sharp words fly out before I know what I\\'m about; and the more I say the  worse I get, till it\\'s a pleasure to hurt people\\'s feelings, and say  dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\"    \"My good mother used to help me--\"    \"As you do us--\" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.    \"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years  had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to  any one else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears  over my failures; for, in spite of my efforts, I never seemed to get on.  Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be  good. But by and by, when I had four little daughters round me, and we  were poor, then the old trouble began again; for I am not patient by  nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\"    \"Poor mother! what helped you then?\"    \"Your father, Jo. He never loses patience,--never doubts or  complains,--but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully, that  one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me,  and showed me that I must try to practise all the virtues I would have  my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try  for your sakes than for my own; a startled or surprised look from one of  you, when I spoke sharply, rebuked me more than any words could have  done; and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the  sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would  have them copy.\"    \"O mother, if I\\'m ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\" cried  Jo, much touched.    \"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear; but you must keep watch  over your \\'bosom enemy,\\' as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not  spoil your life. You have had a warning; remember it, and try with heart  and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater  sorrow and regret than you have known to-day.\"    \"I will try, mother; I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and  keep me from flying out. I used to see father sometimes put his finger  on his lips, and look at you with a very kind, but sober face, and you  always folded your lips tight or went away: was he reminding you then?\"  asked Jo softly.    \"Yes; I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me  from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\"    Jo saw that her mother\\'s eyes filled and her lips trembled, as she  spoke; and, fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,  \"Was it wrong to watch you, and to speak of it? I didn\\'t mean to be  rude, but it\\'s so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so  safe and happy here.\"    \"My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest  happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me, and know how  much I love them.\"    \"I thought I\\'d grieved you.\"    \"No, dear; but speaking of father reminded me how much I miss him, how  much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his  little daughters safe and good for him.\"    \"Yet you told him to go, mother, and didn\\'t cry when he went, and never  complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,\" said Jo, wondering.    \"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was  gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and  will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don\\'t seem to need  help, it is because I have a better friend, even than father, to comfort  and sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are  beginning, and may be many; but you can overcome and outlive them all if  you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as  you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the  nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power  and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken  from you, but may become the source of life-long peace, happiness, and  strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little  cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as  you come to your mother.\"    Jo\\'s only answer was to hold her mother close, and, in the silence which  followed, the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart  without words; for in that sad, yet happy hour, she had learned not only  the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial  and self-control; and, led by her mother\\'s hand, she had drawn nearer to  the Friend who welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of  any father, tenderer than that of any mother.    Amy stirred, and sighed in her sleep; and, as if eager to begin at once  to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it  had never worn before.    \"I let the sun go down on my anger; I wouldn\\'t forgive her, and to-day,  if it hadn\\'t been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I  be so wicked?\" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister,  softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.    As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a  smile that went straight to Jo\\'s heart. Neither said a word, but they  hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was  forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.                        [Illustration: Packing the go abroady trunk]                                      IX.                            MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR.      \"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those  children should have the measles just now,\" said Meg, one April day, as  she stood packing the \"go abroady\" trunk in her room, surrounded by her  sisters.    \"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole  fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,\" replied Jo, looking like a  windmill, as she folded skirts with her long arms.    \"And such lovely weather; I\\'m so glad of that,\" added Beth, tidily  sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great  occasion.    \"I wish I was going to have a fine time, and wear all these nice  things,\" said Amy, with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically  replenished her sister\\'s cushion.    \"I wish you were all going; but, as you can\\'t, I shall keep my  adventures to tell you when I come back. I\\'m sure it\\'s the least I can  do, when you have been so kind, lending me things, and helping me get  ready,\" said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,  which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.    \"What did mother give you out of the treasure-box?\" asked Amy, who had  not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest, in which Mrs.  March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when  the proper time came.    \"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue  sash. I wanted the violet silk; but there isn\\'t time to make it over, so  I must be contented with my old tarlatan.\"    \"It will look nicely over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it  off beautifully. I wish I hadn\\'t smashed my coral bracelet, for you  might have had it,\" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose  possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.    \"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure-box; but  mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,  and Laurie promised to send me all I want,\" replied Meg. \"Now, let me  see; there\\'s my new gray walking-suit--just curl up the feather in my  hat, Beth,--then my poplin, for Sunday, and the small party,--it looks  heavy for spring, doesn\\'t it? The violet silk would be so nice; oh,  dear!\"    \"Never mind; you\\'ve got the tarlatan for the big party, and you always  look like an angel in white,\" said Amy, brooding over the little store  of finery in which her soul delighted.    \"It isn\\'t low-necked, and it doesn\\'t sweep enough, but it will have to  do. My blue house-dress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that  I feel as if I\\'d got a new one. My silk sacque isn\\'t a bit the fashion,  and my bonnet doesn\\'t look like Sallie\\'s; I didn\\'t like to say  anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told mother  black, with a white handle, but she forgot, and bought a green one, with  a yellowish handle. It\\'s strong and neat, so I ought not to complain,  but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie\\'s silk one with a  gold top,\" sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great  disfavor.    \"Change it,\" advised Jo.    \"I won\\'t be so silly, or hurt Marmee\\'s feelings, when she took so much  pains to get my things. It\\'s a nonsensical notion of mine, and I\\'m not  going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves  are my comfort. You are a dear, to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich,  and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for  common;\" and Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove-box.    \"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her night-caps; would you put  some on mine?\" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,  fresh from Hannah\\'s hands.    \"No, I wouldn\\'t; for the smart caps won\\'t match the plain gowns, without  any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn\\'t rig,\" said Jo decidedly.    \"I wonder if I shall _ever_ be happy enough to have real lace on my  clothes, and bows on my caps?\" said Meg impatiently.    \"You said the other day that you\\'d be perfectly happy if you could only  go to Annie Moffat\\'s,\" observed Beth, in her quiet way.    \"So I did! Well, I _am_ happy, and I _won\\'t_ fret; but it does seem as  if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn\\'t it? There, now, the  trays are ready, and everything in but my ball-dress, which I shall  leave for mother to pack,\" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from  the half-filled trunk to the many-times pressed and mended white  tarlatan, which she called her \"ball-dress,\" with an important air.    The next day was fine, and Meg departed, in style, for a fortnight of  novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather  reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented  than she went. But she had begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to  take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after  a winter of irksome work, that the mother yielded, and the daughter went  to take her first taste of fashionable life.    The Moffats _were_ very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,  at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its  occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life  they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,  without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or  intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal  the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was  agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best  frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her  exactly; and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of  those about her; to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,  crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well  as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat\\'s pretty things, the more  she envied her, and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal  as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she  was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves  and silk stockings.    She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls  were busily employed in \"having a good time.\" They shopped, walked,  rode, and called all day; went to theatres and operas, or frolicked at  home in the evening; for Annie had many friends, and knew how to  entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one  was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.  Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father; and Mrs.  Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her  daughter had done. Every one petted her; and \"Daisy,\" as they called  her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.    When the evening for the \"small party\" came, she found that the poplin  wouldn\\'t do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses,  and making themselves very fine indeed; so out came the tarlatan,  looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie\\'s crisp new  one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her  cheeks began to burn, for, with all her gentleness, she was very proud.  No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and  Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white  arms; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her  heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed,  chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter  feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of  flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were  exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.    \"It\\'s for Belle, of course; George always sends her some, but these are  altogether ravishing,\" cried Annie, with a great sniff.    \"They are for Miss March, the man said. And here\\'s a note,\" put in the  maid, holding it to Meg.    \"What fun! Who are they from? Didn\\'t know you had a lover,\" cried the  girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.    \"The note is from mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\" said Meg simply,  yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.    \"Oh, indeed!\" said Annie, with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note  into her pocket, as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false  pride; for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers  cheered her up by their beauty.    Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for  herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the  breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that  Clara, the elder sister, told her she was \"the sweetest little thing she  ever saw;\" and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.  Somehow the kind act finished her despondency; and when all the rest  went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed  face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair, and  fastened the roses in the dress that didn\\'t strike her as so _very_  shabby now.    She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her  heart\\'s content; every one was very kind, and she had three compliments.  Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice;  Major Lincoln asked who \"the fresh little girl, with the beautiful  eyes,\" was; and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her, because she  \"didn\\'t dawdle, but had some spring in her,\" as he gracefully expressed  it. So, altogether, she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit  of a conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just  inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice,  when she heard a voice ask, on the other side of the flowery wall,--    \"How old is he?\"    \"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,\" replied another voice.    \"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn\\'t it? Sallie  says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\"    \"Mrs M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,  early as it is. The girl evidently doesn\\'t think of it yet,\" said Mrs.  Moffat.    \"She told that fib about her mamma, as if she did know, and colored up  when the flowers came, quite prettily. Poor thing! she\\'d be so nice if  she was only got up in style. Do you think she\\'d be offended if we  offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?\" asked another voice.    \"She\\'s proud, but I don\\'t believe she\\'d mind, for that dowdy tarlatan is  all she has got. She may tear it to-night, and that will be a good  excuse for offering a decent one.\"    \"We\\'ll see. I shall ask young Laurence, as a compliment to her, and  we\\'ll have fun about it afterward.\"                     [Illustration: Meg\\'s partner appeared]    Here Meg\\'s partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather  agitated. She _was_ proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it  helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had  just heard; for, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not  help understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it,  but could not, and kept repeating to herself, \"Mrs. M. has made her  plans,\" \"that fib about her mamma,\" and \"dowdy tarlatan,\" till she was  ready to cry, and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As  that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay; and, being rather  excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she  was making. She was very glad when it was all over, and she was quiet in  her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached  and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish,  yet well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed  the peace of the old one, in which, till now, she had lived as happily  as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly  speeches she had overheard; her faith in her mother was a little shaken  by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others  by herself; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple  wardrobe which suited a poor man\\'s daughter, was weakened by the  unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest  calamities under heaven.    Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half  resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not  speaking out frankly, and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled  that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even  to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends  struck Meg at once; they treated her with more respect, she thought;  took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with  eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered  her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her  writing, and said, with a sentimental air,--    \"Daisy, dear, I\\'ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for  Thursday. We should like to know him, and it\\'s only a proper compliment  to you.\"    Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply  demurely,--    \"You are very kind, but I\\'m afraid he won\\'t come.\"    \"Why not, _chérie_?\" asked Miss Belle.    \"He\\'s too old.\"    \"My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!\" cried Miss  Clara.    \"Nearly seventy, I believe,\" answered Meg, counting stitches, to hide  the merriment in her eyes.    \"You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,\" exclaimed Miss  Belle, laughing.    \"There isn\\'t any; Laurie is only a little boy,\" and Meg laughed also at  the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her  supposed lover.    \"About your age,\" Nan said.    \"Nearer my sister Jo\\'s; _I_ am seventeen in August,\" returned Meg,  tossing her head.    \"It\\'s very nice of him to send you flowers, isn\\'t it?\" said Annie,  looking wise about nothing.    \"Yes, he often does, to all of us; for their house is full, and we are  so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,  so it is quite natural that we children should play together;\" and Meg  hoped they would say no more.    \"It\\'s evident Daisy isn\\'t out yet,\" said Miss Clara to Belle, with a  nod.    \"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,\" returned Miss Belle,  with a shrug.    \"I\\'m going out to get some little matters for my girls; can I do  anything for you, young ladies?\" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in, like  an elephant, in silk and lace.    \"No, thank you, ma\\'am,\" replied Sallie. \"I\\'ve got my new pink silk for  Thursday, and don\\'t want a thing.\"    \"Nor I,--\" began Meg, but stopped, because it occurred to her that she  _did_ want several things, and could not have them.    \"What shall you wear?\" asked Sallie.    \"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got sadly  torn last night,\" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling  very uncomfortable.    \"Why don\\'t you send home for another?\" said Sallie, who was not an  observing young lady.    \"I haven\\'t got any other.\" It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie  did not see it, and exclaimed, in amiable surprise,--    \"Only that? How funny--\" She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook  her head at her, and broke in, saying kindly,--    \"Not at all; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn\\'t  out? There\\'s no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen,  for I\\'ve got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I\\'ve outgrown, and you  shall wear it, to please me, won\\'t you, dear?\"    \"You are very kind, but I don\\'t mind my old dress, if you don\\'t; it does  well enough for a little girl like me,\" said Meg.    \"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do  it, and you\\'d be a regular little beauty, with a touch here and there. I  sha\\'n\\'t let any one see you till you are done, and then we\\'ll burst upon  them like Cinderella and her godmother, going to the ball,\" said Belle,  in her persuasive tone.    Meg couldn\\'t refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she  would be \"a little beauty\" after touching up, caused her to accept, and  forget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the Moffats.    On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid; and,  between them, they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled  her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,  touched her lips with coralline salve, to make them redder, and Hortense  would have added \"a _soupçon_ of rouge,\" if Meg had not rebelled. They  laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly  breathe, and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in  the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,  brooch, and even ear-rings, for Hortense tied them on, with a bit of  pink silk, which did not show. A cluster of tea-rosebuds at the bosom,  and a _ruche_, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white  shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last  wish of her heart. A laced handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a  silver holder finished her off; and Miss Belle surveyed her with the  satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.    \"Mademoiselle is charmante, très jolie, is she not?\" cried Hortense,  clasping her hands in an affected rapture.    \"Come and show yourself,\" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room  where the others were waiting.    As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her ear-rings  tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her  \"fun\" had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that  she _was_ \"a little beauty.\" Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase  enthusiastically; and, for several minutes, she stood, like the jackdaw  in the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered  like a party of magpies.    \"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt,  and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver  butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,  Clara, and don\\'t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\" said  Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.    \"I\\'m afraid to go down, I feel so queer and stiff and half-dressed,\"  said Meg to Sallie, as the bell rang, and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask the  young ladies to appear at once.    \"You don\\'t look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I\\'m nowhere  beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you\\'re quite French, I  assure you. Let your flowers hang; don\\'t be so careful of them, and be  sure you don\\'t trip,\" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was  prettier than herself.                     [Illustration: Asked to be introduced]    Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs,  and sailed into the drawing-rooms, where the Moffats and a few early  guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm  about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people, and secures  their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her  before, were very affectionate all of a sudden; several young gentlemen,  who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but  asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable  things to her; and several old ladies, who sat on sofas, and criticised  the rest of the party, inquired who she was, with an air of interest.  She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them,--    \"Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,  but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;  sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.\"    \"Dear me!\" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another  observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard, and been  rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat\\'s fibs.    The \"queer feeling\" did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting  the new part of fine lady, and so got on pretty well, though the tight  dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and  she was in constant fear lest her ear-rings should fly off, and get lost  or broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of  a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped  laughing and looked confused; for, just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was  staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she  thought; for, though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest  eyes made her blush, and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her  confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to  Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.    \"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head! I won\\'t care for  it, or let it change me a bit,\" thought Meg, and rustled across the room  to shake hands with her friend.    \"I\\'m glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn\\'t,\" she said, with her most  grown-up air.    \"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did;\" answered  Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her  maternal tone.    \"What shall you tell her?\" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his  opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him, for the first time.    \"I shall say I didn\\'t know you; for you look so grown-up, and unlike  yourself, I\\'m quite afraid of you,\" he said, fumbling at his  glove-button.    \"How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like  it. Wouldn\\'t Jo stare if she saw me?\" said Meg, bent on making him say  whether he thought her improved or not.    \"Yes, I think she would,\" returned Laurie gravely.    \"Don\\'t you like me so?\" asked Meg.    \"No, I don\\'t,\" was the blunt reply.    \"Why not?\" in an anxious tone.    He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically  trimmed dress, with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,  which had not a particle of his usual politeness about it.    \"I don\\'t like fuss and feathers.\"    That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself; and Meg  walked away, saying petulantly,--    \"You are the rudest boy I ever saw.\"    Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window, to cool  her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant  color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by; and, a minute after,  she heard him saying to his mother,--    \"They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her,  but they have spoilt her entirely; she\\'s nothing but a doll, to-night.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" sighed Meg; \"I wish I\\'d been sensible, and worn my own  things; then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so  uncomfortable and ashamed myself.\"    She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the  curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one  touched her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said,  with his very best bow, and his hand out,--    \"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\"    \"I\\'m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\" said Meg, trying to  look offended, and failing entirely.    \"Not a bit of it; I\\'m dying to do it. Come, I\\'ll be good; I don\\'t like  your gown, but I do think you are--just splendid;\" and he waved his  hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.    Meg smiled and relented, and whispered, as they stood waiting to catch  the time,--    \"Take care my skirt don\\'t trip you up; it\\'s the plague of my life, and I  was a goose to wear it.\"    \"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,\" said Laurie,  looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.    Away they went, fleetly and gracefully; for, having practised at home,  they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant  sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more  friendly than ever after their small tiff.    \"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor; will you?\" said Meg, as he stood  fanning her, when her breath gave out, which it did very soon, though  she would not own why.    \"Won\\'t I!\" said Laurie, with alacrity.    \"Please don\\'t tell them at home about my dress to-night. They won\\'t  understand the joke, and it will worry mother.\"    \"Then why did you do it?\" said Laurie\\'s eyes, so plainly that Meg  hastily added,--    \"I shall tell them, myself, all about it, and \\'\\'fess\\' to mother how  silly I\\'ve been. But I\\'d rather do it myself; so you\\'ll not tell, will  you?\"    \"I give you my word I won\\'t; only what shall I say when they ask me?\"    \"Just say I looked pretty well, and was having a good time.\"    \"I\\'ll say the first, with all my heart; but how about the other? You  don\\'t look as if you were having a good time; are you?\" and Laurie  looked at her with an expression which made her answer, in a whisper,--    \"No; not just now. Don\\'t think I\\'m horrid; I only wanted a little fun,  but this sort doesn\\'t pay, I find, and I\\'m getting tired of it.\"    \"Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?\" said Laurie, knitting his  black brows, as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a  pleasant addition to the party.    \"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he\\'s coming for  them. What a bore!\" said Meg, assuming a languid air, which amused  Laurie immensely.    He did not speak to her again till supper-time, when he saw her drinking  champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving \"like a pair  of fools,\" as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of  right to watch over the Marches, and fight their battles whenever a  defender was needed.                        [Illustration: I wouldn\\'t, Meg]    \"You\\'ll have a splitting headache to-morrow, if you drink much of that.  I wouldn\\'t Meg; your mother doesn\\'t like it, you know,\" he whispered,  leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass, and Fisher  stooped to pick up her fan.    \"I\\'m not Meg, to-night; I\\'m \\'a doll,\\' who does all sorts of crazy  things. To-morrow I shall put away my \\'fuss and feathers,\\' and be  desperately good again,\" she answered, with an affected little laugh.    \"Wish to-morrow was here, then,\" muttered Laurie, walking off,  ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.    Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did;  after supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly  upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that  scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no  chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say  good-night.    \"Remember!\" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had  already begun.    \"Silence à la mort,\" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he  went away.    This little bit of by-play excited Annie\\'s curiosity; but Meg was too  tired for gossip, and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a  masquerade, and hadn\\'t enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was  sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her  fortnight\\'s fun, and feeling that she had \"sat in the lap of luxury\"  long enough.    \"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all  the time. Home _is_ a nice place, though it isn\\'t splendid,\" said Meg,  looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother  and Jo on the Sunday evening.    \"I\\'m glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem  dull and poor to you, after your fine quarters,\" replied her mother, who  had given her many anxious looks that day; for motherly eyes are quick  to see any change in children\\'s faces.    Meg had told her adventures gayly, and said over and over what a  charming time she had had; but something still seemed to weigh upon her  spirits, and, when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat  thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little, and looking worried. As  the clock struck nine, and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair,  and, taking Beth\\'s stool, leaned her elbows on her mother\\'s knee, saying  bravely,--    \"Marmee, I want to \\'\\'fess.\\'\"    \"I thought so; what is it, dear?\"    \"Shall I go away?\" asked Jo discreetly.    \"Of course not; don\\'t I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to  speak of it before the children, but I want you to know all the dreadful  things I did at the Moffat\\'s.\"    \"We are prepared,\" said Mrs. March, smiling, but looking a little  anxious.    \"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn\\'t tell you that they powdered  and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie  thought I wasn\\'t proper; I know he did, though he didn\\'t say so, and one  man called me \\'a doll.\\' I knew it was silly, but they flattered me, and  said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a  fool of me.\"    \"Is that all?\" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast  face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame  her little follies.    \"No; I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether  abominable,\" said Meg self-reproachfully.    \"There is something more, I think;\" and Mrs. March smoothed the soft  cheek, which suddenly grew rosy, as Meg answered slowly,--    \"Yes; it\\'s very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have  people say and think such things about us and Laurie.\"    Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats;  and, as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill  pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg\\'s innocent mind.    \"Well, if that isn\\'t the greatest rubbish I ever heard,\" cried Jo  indignantly. \"Why didn\\'t you pop out and tell them so, on the spot?\"    \"I couldn\\'t, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn\\'t help hearing, at  first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn\\'t remember that I  ought to go away.\"    \"Just wait till _I_ see Annie Moffat, and I\\'ll show you how to settle  such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having \\'plans,\\' and being kind to  Laurie, because he\\'s rich, and may marry us by and by! Won\\'t he shout,  when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\" and  Jo laughed, as if, on second thoughts, the thing struck her as a good  joke.    \"If you tell Laurie, I\\'ll never forgive you! She mustn\\'t, must she,  mother?\" said Meg, looking distressed.    \"No; never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you  can,\" said Mrs. March gravely. \"I was very unwise to let you go among  people of whom I know so little,--kind, I dare say, but worldly,  ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more  sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,  Meg.\"    \"Don\\'t be sorry, I won\\'t let it hurt me; I\\'ll forget all the bad, and  remember only the good; for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very  much for letting me go. I\\'ll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, mother;  I know I\\'m a silly little girl, and I\\'ll stay with you till I\\'m fit to  take care of myself. But it _is_ nice to be praised and admired, and I  can\\'t help saying I like it,\" said Meg, looking half ashamed of the  confession.    \"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not  become a passion, and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn  to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the  admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg.\"    Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind  her, looking both interested and a little perplexed; for it was a new  thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and  things of that sort; and Jo felt as if, during that fortnight, her  sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a  world where she could not follow.    \"Mother, do you have \\'plans,\\' as Mrs. Moffat said?\" asked Meg bashfully.    \"Yes, my dear, I have a great many; all mothers do, but mine differ  somewhat from Mrs. Moffat\\'s, I suspect. I will tell you some of them,  for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and  heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but  not too young to understand me; and mothers\\' lips are the fittest to  speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time,  perhaps, so listen to my \\'plans,\\' and help me carry them out, if they  are good.\"    Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they  were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,  and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her  serious yet cheery way,--          [Illustration: Holding a hand of each, Mrs. March said, &c.]    \"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be  admired, loved, and respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and  wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care  and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen  by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a  woman; and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience.  It is natural to think of it, Meg; right to hope and wait for it, and  wise to prepare for it; so that, when the happy time comes, you may  feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I _am_  ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world,--marry  rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which  are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious  thing,--and, when well used, a noble thing,--but I never want you to  think it is the first or only prize to strive for. I\\'d rather see you  poor men\\'s wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on  thrones, without self-respect and peace.\"    \"Poor girls don\\'t stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put  themselves forward,\" sighed Meg.    \"Then we\\'ll be old maids,\" said Jo stoutly.    \"Right, Jo; better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly  girls, running about to find husbands,\" said Mrs. March decidedly.  \"Don\\'t be troubled, Meg; poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of  the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so  love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these  things to time; make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes  of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are  not. One thing remember, my girls: mother is always ready to be your  confidant, father to be your friend; and both of us trust and hope that  our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort  of our lives.\"    \"We will, Marmee, we will!\" cried both, with all their hearts, as she  bade them good-night.                                             X.                              THE P. C. AND P. O.      As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the  lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.  The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the  little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, \"I\\'d know  which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see \\'em in Chiny;\" and so  she might, for the girls\\' tastes differed as much as their characters.  Meg\\'s had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange-tree in it.  Jo\\'s bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying  experiments; this year it was to be a plantation of sun-flowers, the  seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed \"Aunt  Cockle-top\" and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned, fragrant  flowers in her garden,--sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,  pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the bird, and catnip for  the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers,--rather small and earwiggy, but  very pretty to look at,--with honeysuckles and morning-glories hanging  their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it; tall,  white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants  as would consent to blossom there.
